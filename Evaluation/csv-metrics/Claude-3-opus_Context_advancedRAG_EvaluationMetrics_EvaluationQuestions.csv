1G advanced RAG,Was ist der Stellenwert von PRRT innerhalb GEP-NET?,german,general,therapy,claude-3-opus-20240229 advanced RAG,"Basierend auf den gegebenen Informationen hat die Peptidrezeptor-Radionuklidtherapie (PRRT) folgenden Stellenwert innerhalb der gastroenteropankreatischen neuroendokrinen Tumoren (GEP-NET):

- Bei Midgut-NET, die unter Somatostatin-Analoga (SSA) fortschreiten, ist PRRT klar positioniert. Der genaue Stellenwert bei pankreatischen NET muss noch evaluiert werden [1].

- Bei pankreatischen NET zeigen retrospektive Studien eine Wirksamkeit der PRRT hinsichtlich Krankheitskontrolle und geringer Toxizität. Eine Metaanalyse ergab höhere objektive Ansprechraten, Krankheitskontrollraten und progressionsfreies Überleben für PRRT im Vergleich zu Everolimus [1]. 

- Bei GEP-NET Patienten mit großer Tumorlast oder hoher Proliferationsrate (Ki-67 10-55%) kann 177Lu-DOTATATE aufgrund der Ansprechraten von 39-55% als First-Line-Therapie erwogen werden, wenn ein Ansprechen klinisch erforderlich ist [2].

- Bei hochgradigen neuroendokrinen Neoplasien (NEN) wie Grad 3 NET und neuroendokrinen Karzinomen (NEC) mit Ki-67 21-55% könnte PRRT in Betracht gezogen werden, sofern die Läsionen eine SSTR-Aufnahme zeigen [2].","['The objective response rate was\nhigher with PRRT compared to everolimus (47% vs. 12% respectively , p< 0.001), as was the\nrate of disease control (81% vs. 73% respectively, p< 0.001), and progression-free survival\n(25.7 months vs. 14.7 months respectively , p< 0.001). The tolerance profile was also better with\nPRRT than everolimus. Grade 3/4 hematotoxicity was found in 5% of cases with PRRT versus\n11% with everolimus ( p= 0.02). This result is less contrasted for grade 3/4 nephrotoxicity\nfound in 1% of PRRT and 2.5% of everolimus treatments ( p= 0.34). The number of treatment\ninterruptions related to its toxicity was 59 in the everolimus arm versus 0 in the PRRT arm [ 22].\nThese findings suggest that PRRT is effective in controlling disease in patients who are not\namenable to surgical treatment, as well as less toxicity (Table 2, [ 6,9–13,21,23–25]) compared\nto other treatment alternatives. Nevertheless, these data for pancreatic NETs need to be\nconfirmed by a prospective, randomized, double-blind, phase 3 study , similar to the NETTER-\n1 trial for NET in the small intestine. A possible role for PRRT as a neoadjuvant agent has\nbeen suggested by case reports or small case series, but need to be further explored [26]\nFurthermore,90Y-DOTATOC have also been tested prospectively in panNET [ 27]\nmainly by a phase 2 trial including 342 patients with an ORR of 47% [ 7]. Pancreatic NETs\nare more sensitive to the cytotoxic chemotherapy than other NETs. Thus, the place of the\nPRRT in the treatment strategy has to be evaluated.\nIn summary, the PRRT is perfectly positioned in midgut NETs progressing under SSA\nand has yet to ﬁnd its place in pancreatic NETs.', 'J. Clin. Med. 2021 ,10, 1267 6 of 15\nMore recently , some studies have investigated the role of PRRT in high-grade (G3, Ki-67\n> 20%) gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) neuroendocrine neoplasms, called NEN G3. NEN G3\nincluded well differentiated tumor (NET G3) and poorly differentiated (Neuroendocrine\ncarcinoma, NEC), as described in the 2017 WHO classification for pancreatic NEN [ 17], with a\nsimilar expansion to gastrointestinal G3 tumors anticipated in the next WHO classification. In\na study population of 19 well differentiated grade 3 NETs [ 9], a mean overall survival time of\n38 months was observed. Other studies, including both NET G3, and NEC, have suggested a\nbenefit on clinical outcome [ 18–20]. Particularly , in a multicenter retrospective study including\n149 patients with GEP NEN G3, PRRT demonstrates promising response rates, disease control\nrates, PFS and OS [ 19]68Ga-SSTR PET/CT and 18FDG PET/CT may also help to select the\nNET G3 patients who might benefit from PRRT. Indeed, a high SUV on SSTR PET/CT and no\nor minor 18F-FDG avidity appeared to be associated with a better prognosis [18].\n4.2. Pancreatic NET\nIn pancreatic NETs, the effects are not conﬁrmed by a controlled randomized Phase III\nstudy (Table 2). Available data consist of multiple single-arm prospective and retrospective\ntrials. A Retrospective study series of 68 patients treated for pancreatic NET and having\nreceived four cycles of177Lu-DOTATATE at 8 GBq showed no beneﬁt in terms of survival\nin patients ( n= 35) treated with PRRT on the front line [ 21]. On the other hand, signals\nin favor of an efﬁciency are identiﬁed. In this cohort a disease control rate of 85% and a\nmedian time to progression of 34 months was observed [6].\nOther retrospective studies argue for efficacy in disease control and low toxicity of PRRT\nin pancreatic NETs. A retrospective series of 443 gastroenteropancreatic and pulmonary\nneuroendocrine tumours, including 133 pancreatic NETs, showed a disease control rate of\n84% and an objective response rate of 54% in the pancreatic tumour subgroup. The median\nprogression-free survival was 30 months and overall survival was 71 months in this subgroup.\nShort-term tolerability was marked by nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain (related to the\nprior infusion of amino acids during the177Lu DOTATATE treatment to decrease absorption,\nand thus toxicity , in the kidney). No short-term hematotoxicity or renal toxicity was found in\nthis series. Long-term toxicity was marked by four cases of acute leukemia (0.7% of the study\npopulation) and nine cases of myelodysplastic syndrome (1.5%). [10].\nA meta-analysis comparing the efficacy of PRRT with177Lu DOTATATE and everolimus\n(one of the therapeutic alternatives to PRRT in gastroenteropancreatic NET not accessible\nto surgical treatment) compared 15 articles reporting 697 patients treated with PRRT and\n12 articles reporting 946 patients treated with everolimus. The objective response rate was\nhigher with PRRT compared to everolimus (47% vs. 12% respectively , p< 0.001), as was the\nrate of disease control (81% vs. 73% respectively, p< 0.001), and progression-free survival\n(25.7 months vs. 14.7 months respectively , p< 0.001). The tolerance profile was also better with\nPRRT than everolimus. Grade 3/4 hematotoxicity was found in 5% of cases with PRRT versus\n11% with everolimus ( p= 0.02). This result is less contrasted for grade 3/4 nephrotoxicity\nfound in 1% of PRRT and 2.5% of everolimus treatments ( p= 0.34).', 'Cancers 2022 ,14, 5792 7 of 17\ncompared to 11.0 months for sunitinib treatment in patients with advanced, SSTR-positive,\nprogressive panNET [ 70]. Currently, the randomized phase III COMPETE trial is comparing\nPRRT with177Lu-edotreotide with everolimus in advanced, progressive GEP-NET patients.\nA subset of GEP-NET patients present with extensive tumor bulk or high proliferative rate\n(Ki-67 index of 10–55%). In these cases, treatment with octreotide LAR or lanreotide has\nquestionable antiproliferative effects [ 71]. Given its ORR of 39%, which increases to 55% in\npanNETs [ 29],177Lu-DOTATATE can be considered as ﬁrst-line therapy if response is clini-\ncally necessitated [ 72]. These response rates compare favorably to targeted therapy [ 73–75]\nand for panNETs appear similar to capecitabine–temozolomide chemotherapy [ 76]. Poorly\ndifferentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs) and well-differentiated grade 3 NETs\nare high-grade NENs that display a more aggressive biological behavior than the more\ncommon grade 1 and 2 NETs [ 77]. PRRT is currently not considered a standard treatment\noption for high-grade NENs [68,78]. The rate of SSTR 2expression in grade 3 NETs ranges\nfrom 67–92% and in NECs from 32–50%, compared to a positive expression rate in grade 1\nand 2 NETs ranging from 67–96% [ 5,79–82]. In a meta-analysis of PRRT comprising four\nstudies, grade 3 NET patients had a median PFS of 19 months and median OS of 44 months\nafter PRRT. The median PFS was 11 and 4 months and the median OS was 22 and 9 months\nfor NEC with a Ki-67 of 21–55% and NEC with a Ki-67 above 55%, respectively [ 83]. Recent\nstudies implicated that PRRT could be considered in grade 3 GEP-NETs and GEP-NEC\nwith a Ki-67 of 21–55%. Importantly, to qualify for PRRT, uptake in all lesions is required\non somatostatin receptor imaging [83].\n7. Eligibility Criteria for PRRT\nThere are several inclusion and exclusion criteria to decide if a patient is eligible for\ntreatment with PRRT. A key criterion for PRRT is the degree of uptake on SSTR imaging\nwhich is scored by the Krenning score based on planar111In-DTPA-octereotide imaging.\nIt was reported that68Ga-DOTA-SSA PET/CT results in higher Krenning scores than\n111In-DTPA-octereotide imaging [ 84]. The uptake of all tumor lesions should minimally\nbe equal to the physiological uptake in the liver (Krenning score grade 2) on111In-DTPA-\noctreotide scintigraphy or higher than the physiological uptake in the liver on68Ga-DOTA-\nSSA PET/CT for a patient to be eligible for PRRT. The latter functional imaging is more\naccurate for detecting SSTR-positive primary tumors and metastases and therefore su-\nperior for assessing the total extent of disease [ 85–87]. PRRT is only applicable for pa-\ntients with a Karnofsky Performance Scale of at least 60 [ 27]. PRRT is contra-indicated\nfor patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding, patients with severe cardiac impairment\n(NYHA III or IV) and those with a life expectancy less than 3 months [ 31]. Since PRRT\ncan induce toxicity, the following pre-treatment laboratory values are required: creatinine\nclearance > 40 mL/min, hemoglobin levels ≥6 mmol/L, leukocytes > 2 ×109/L, platelet\ncount > 75 ×109/L, bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) and aspartate aminotrans-\nferase (ASAT) < 3 times the upper limit of normal and albumin > 3 g/dL [2,3].\n8.']",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1.0,1.0,1.0,133
1E advanced RAG,What is the role of PRRT in GEP-NET?,english,general,therapy,claude-3-opus-20240229 advanced RAG,"Based on the provided context, peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) plays an important role in the treatment of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs):

1. PRRT is a validated treatment option for GEP-NETs that strongly overexpress somatostatin receptors (SSTRs), especially in well-differentiated grade 1/2 NETs [1].

2. The NETTER-1 Phase III randomized trial confirmed the low toxicity and effectiveness of 177Lu-DOTATATE in tumor control for metastatic midgut NETs after disease progression under somatostatin analogues [1,2]. 

3. PRRT is considered a viable option for inoperable and metastatic grade 1 and 2 GEP-NETs (Ki-67 LI up to 20%) that have failed first-line somatostatin treatment and express high levels of SSTRs [3].

4. The effectiveness of PRRT in GEP-NETs is correlated with the tumor volume, location of the primary tumor, and degree of SSTR expression [1].

In summary, PRRT is an important targeted treatment modality for advanced, SSTR-positive GEP-NETs, offering tumor control with low toxicity.","['J. Clin. Med. 2021 ,10, 1267 4 of 15\n4. Indications of PRRT in NETs\n4.1. Gastrointestinal NET\nStudies on the role of PRRT in Grade 1–2 gastrointestinal NETs were evaluated with\ntwo different plotters:90Y-DOTATOC and177Lu-DOTATATE. The use of90Y-DOTATOC\nat a dose of 3.7 GBq/m2in 1109 patients with gastrointestinal NET ( n= 387), pancreatic\n(n= 342), pulmonary ( n= 84) or other ( n= 296) showed a morphologic response rate by\n34% measured by a decrease in the sum of the longest diameters of all pretherapeutically\ndetected tumor lesions. to the response assessment criteria usual radiological RECIST.\nIn patients with intestinal and pancreatic NET, the levels of objective responses were\n47% and 27%, respectively. In the overall population, the median of overall survival was\n95 months [ 7]. The comparison clinical trials and retrospective series on the PRRT with\nthe use of90Y-DOTATOC in the gastroenteropancreatic NETs is impossible because the\npatient selection procedures, the criteria for ﬁxation of the tracer to pre-therapeutic imaging,\nand infusion protocols differ widely in function of the studies. Currently, based on the\nNETTER-1 study, the177LuDOTATATE- is the most widely used radiopeptide.\n177Lu-DOTATATE is currently the more widely used radiopeptide. This radiolabel has\ndemonstrated an efﬁciency similar to90Y-DOTATOC, but with lower toxicity, especially\nhematologic (Table 1, [ 2,8–14]). In a serie of 310 patients treated for Gastroenteropancreatic\nNET per four cycles of 7.4 GBq of177Lu-DOTATATE, it was found an objective response\nrate of 30%. Poor general condition (Karnofsky score < 70%) and liver damage were\nassociated with an incorrect response to the treatment. For example,177Lu-DOTATATE and\n90Y-DOTATOC treatments are associated with poor results when tumor volume is high [ 15].\nIn a meta-analysis of 473 patients treated with177Lu-DOTATATE for a NET, objective\nresponse rates ranged from 18% to 44% depending on the RECIST criteria, with an average\ndisease control rate of 81% [ 16]. Retrospective and Phase II studies of177Lu-DOTATATE\nshowed a median progression-free survival of 33–36 months in patients with metastatic\nsmall size NET with documented tumor progression and/or an uncontrolled carcinoid\nsymptom [8].\nIn this context, the NETTER-1 (Phase III randomized study) has evaluated and po-\nsitioned the place of the PRRT at a very early stage in the management of patients with\nmetastatical midgut NET [ 2]. This study compared 229 patients with advanced metastatic\nmidgut NET, an Octreoscanner binding and progression under SSA at a ﬁxed dose of 30 mg\nper month Octreotide,177Lu-DOTATATE versus 60 mg per month of Octreotide (double\ndose). The study’s outcome was progression-free survival evaluated according to the radio-\nlogical criteria RECIST 1.1. The treatment with177Lu-DOTATATE resulted in a reduction of\n79% of the risk of progression or death, compared to double-dose Octreotide (p< 0.0001) .\nThe median survival progression was not reached in the group treated with PRRT versus\n8.4 months in the control group. Moreover, treatment with PRRT was associated with\na rate of objective response of 18% versus 3% with Octreotide ( p< 0.0004). Thus, and\nbased on this Phase III data,177Lu-DOTATATE is positioned as a new therapeutic option\nin grade 1–2 midgut NETs after disease progression under SSA and has been obtained\nmarketing authorization for this indication. It is important to note that long-term follow-up\nis necessary in order to assess the impact of this new treatment on the overall patient\nsurvival.', 'If GEP-NETS are resectable, surgery is the primary ap-\nproach. Patients with unresectable metastatic disease usually\ngo through multiple lines of treatments including somatostatin\nanalogue (SSA) therapy or targeted therapy, such as everoli-mus (mTOR inhibitor) or sunitinib (tyrosine kinase inhibitor)\n[7]. In patients with grade 1 and 2 NETs (Ki-7 LI of up to\n20%) that are inoperable and metastatic, who have failed first-\nline somatostatin treatment, and whose tumors express high\nlevels of somatostatin receptors (SSTRs), peptide receptor ra-\ndionuclide therapy (PRRT) would be a viable option. PRRTusually involves DOTATOC, DOTATATE, and DOTANOC\nlabeled either with\n90Yor177Lu [7]. Patients included in study\nprotocols have positive NET histology and SSTR scintigraphy\nwith111In OctreoScan or68Ga PET-Dota-peptide (Fig. 1). A\npositive scan denotes lesion uptake that is equal to or greaterthan the liver uptake [ 8]. Important criteria to be taken into\naccount when considering PRRT include objective disease\nprogression, adequate blood profile (hemoglobin, white cell,\nand platelet count levels), creatinine, and ECOG performancescore ≤2[8]. A good performance status means the patient\nwould be self-sufficient and reduces the need for physicalassistance during the treatment period (3 days/cycle).Recently published European Society for Medical Oncology\n(ESMO) Clinical Practice Guidelines have recommended\nPRRT up to the upper limit of Ki-67 LI to 30% [ 9].\nScintigraphic or PET tomoscintigraphic evaluation is to datethe most accurate noninvasive method to identify and confirmthe overexpression of functioning receptors [ 10]. An impor-\ntant issue in the consideration of PRRT is that the somatostatinreceptors should be functional, i.e., able to internalize the re-ceptor analogue complex and retain the radioactivity inside\nthe cell. The critical issues for effective therapy are somato-\nstatin receptor overexpression and the evidence of functional-ity. The nuclear physician can calculate a tumor-to-liver ratio\nas a relative measure of receptor number [ 11]; this ratio must\nbe high for PRRT eligibility.Mechanism of Action and Constituents\nof Radiolabeled SSAs\nSomatostatin ’s actions include inhibiting hormone secretion,\nsuppressing the release of insulin-like growth factors,\ninhibiting angiogenesis, and inducing apoptosis in the tumor\ntissue [ 12]. Such biologic effects are mediated through inter-\naction with five subtypes of somatostatin receptors (SSTR1-\n5), which belong to the seven-transmembrane domain, G-\nprotein-coupled receptor superfamily. The currently approvedSSAs are octreotide and lanreotide, in slow-release formula-\ntions, long-acting release (LAR), and supersaturated solution\n(Autogel®).\nDue to the overexpression of SSTRs in NETs, which is\nestimated to be in around 80% of NETs, they are consideredsuitable targets for PRRT with radiolabeled SSA. Once boundto their receptor, radiolabeled SSAs are internalized as per\nnormal receptor recycling dynamics, and the breakdown prod-\nucts of the radiolabeled peptides are stored in lysosomes, thusenabling delivery and causing suspension of radioactivity in-\nside the tumor cell [ 13]. This would result in radiation-induced\nDNA damage of the tumor cell and its eventual death.\nRadiolabeled SSAs are made up of three main constituents;\na radionuclide isotope, a ligand or carrier molecule (TOC or\nTATE), and a chelator or linker (DOTA) that binds them to-\ngether and stabilizes the complex (Fig. 2). Chelators mainly\nused include DOTA (tetraazacyclododecane tetra-acetic acid)\nand DTPA (diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid), while\noctreotide and octreotate (TOC and TATE, respectively) are\ngenerally used as ligands [ 14]. The most known and studied\nSSA is octreotide.', 'J. Clin. Med. 2021 ,10, 1267 2 of 15\n(SSTR). For many years, evidence of an anti-tumor effect of PRRT were only obtained from\nnon-randomized Phase II trials or retrospective studies. The NETTER-1 Phase III Random-\nized Trial finally validated this treatment option by confirming its low toxicity but also its\neffectiveness in tumor control. Following these results,177Lu-DOTATATE was approved by\nthe US Food and Drug Administration in 2018 and the European Medicines Agency in 2017\nfor the treatment of gastroenteropancreatic NETs that are well differentiated and obtain a\nprescription authorization in France in metastatic midgut NETs [ 2]. Some interesting data\nexist for pancreatic and pulmonary NETs. In this review, we discuss the clinical efficiency of\nPRRT in gastroenteropancreatic and pulmonary NETs.\n2. Somatostatin Receptors (SSTR) and Radio-Labelled Somatostatin Analogues\nEffect of PRRT is correlated with the ability for the markers to ﬁx the SSTR (SSTR1-5).\nThis therapy is therefore dedicated to NETs who strongly over expressed those receptors.\nSSTRs belong to a family of G-protein coupled receptors with seven transmembrane\ndomains. The majority of well differentiated gastroenteropancreatic and pulmonary NETs\nare characterized by the strong expression of SSTR, including SSTR2 Grade 1/2 NETs\nexpress the SSTR more often and at higher levels than grade 3 NETs. When linked to the\nreceptors, radiolabeled somatostatin analogues are internalized according to the normal\nrecycling dynamics of membrane receptors and the degradation products of peptides\nare stored in lysosomes, in intracellular, which allows for the release and retention of\nradioactivity inside tumor cells [ 3]. This mechanism accounts for the low toxicity of the\nPRRT on the healthy cells. Radiolabelled somatostatin analogs are made up of an isotope\nradionuclide, a carrier molecule (derived from octreotide), and a chelating agent that binds\nthem together and stabilizes the complex. The commonly used chelating agents are DOTA\n(DOTA acid and tetra-azacyclododecane-tetra-acetic) and DTPA (di-ethylenetriamine penta-\naceticacid). Three radionucleides (111In,90Y and177Lu) were conjugated to the somatostatin\nanalogues and their different physical characteristics confer speciﬁc advantages. The90Y\nand177Lu emit beta particles with higher energy and longer ranges, which translates into\ngreater therapeutic potential. Due to the emission of gamma rays, the177Lu can also be\nused for dosimetry and monitoring of tumor response [4].\n3. Modalities of Realization and Patients Selection\nPRRT is the single validated treatment option in the NETs, which for there is a pre-\ndictive marker of answer: the expression of SSTR. Response rates have been shown to\nbe increased in patients with a higher degree of absorption of radiotracers in the case of\n111In-pentetreotid scintigraphy An overall response rate of approximately 60% has been\nreported in patients with a grade 4 according to the Krenning score, corresponding to a tu-\nmor absorption greater than that of the spleen, and kidneys. Intense ﬁxation (SUV) greater\nthan 16 on the68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT is a predictive marker of high tumor response\n(sensitivity: 95%; specﬁcity: 60 %) [ 5] (Figure 1). The effectiveness of PRRT is correlated\nwith the tumor volume and the location of the primary tumor (amount of SSTR present\non the tumor cell) (Figure 2). Thus, NETs with high liver tumor volume are considered\nto be less sensitive to PRRT [ 6]. Similarly, it is suggested that pancreatic NETs frequently\nrespond to the PRRT but with an earlier progression than in midgut NETs. The treatment\nmodalities are relatively standardized in France with a treatment carried out by infusion\nof radiolabel split in four cycles spaced eight weeks apart.']",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0.0,1.0,0.5,150

Clinical Studies and Approvals\nToday, PRRT with radiolabeled SST agonists (e.g., DOTA-TOC or DOTA-TATE, Table 1)\nis part of the standard of care of NENs. NETTER-1 (NCT01578239; EudraCT number\n2011-005049-11 ) was the ﬁrst prospective, open-label, randomized, phase III trial to com-\npare four cycles of177Lu-DOTA-TATE (4 ×7.4 GBq) plus 30 mg long-acting release oc-\ntreotide (PRRT group, n = 117) with high-dose (60 mg double dose) long-acting release\noctreotide (control group, n = 114) in advanced, progressive midgut NET patients. There\nwas a signiﬁcantly longer progression-free survival for the PRRT arm ( p< 0.001) [ 22]\nand a signiﬁcant improvement in quality of life [ 23]. Consequently,177Lu-DOTA-TATE\n(177Lu-oxodotreotide ) received marketing authorization for the treatment of adult patients\nwith SST-positive gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs). At the ﬁnal\nanalysis of overall survival (OS), the median OS was improved by 11.7 months for the\n177Lu-DOTA-TATE arm versus the control arm (48.0 (95% CI, 37.4–55.2) vs. 36.3 (95% CI,\n25.9–51.7) months, respectively), which, however, did not reach statistical signiﬁcance in the\nlong-term follow-up with a median of 6.3 years [ 24]. Regarding safety, the NETTER-1 data\nshow a low incidence of long-term side-effects regarding hematotoxicity and nephrotoxicity.\nCurrently , a second prospective, randomized, controlled, open-label, multi-center, phase\nIII trial, COMPETE (NCT03049189), is ongoing, in which PRRT using177Lu-DOTA-TOC\n(177Lu-edotreotide, four cycles with 7.5 GBq/cycle) is being compared with the mTOR\ninhibitor everolimus (10 mg daily) in patients with progressive, SST-positive GEP-NETs.\nUpon completion of the study, the approval of177Lu-DOTA-TOC is expected. These\ntrials and other trials (e.g., OCCLURANDOM, NCT02230176) should further precisely\ndetermine the position of PRRT in the current clinical algorithm with regard to other\nsystemic therapies, such as everolimus and sunitinib.\nUsing routes other than intravenous administration may be an interesting approach to\nenhance the therapeutic and safety window of PRRT. NENs and their liver metastases are\noften highly perfused, and the intra-arterial route can exploit the ﬁrst-pass effect to treat\nliver-dominant disease more efﬁciently. Such an approach can also be used for inoperable\nprimary tumors to downstage the disease in the neoadjuvant setting [ 25,26]. However,\nlarge comparative prospective trials supporting its wider use are missing.', 'Cancers 2022 ,14, 5792 7 of 17\ncompared to 11.0 months for sunitinib treatment in patients with advanced, SSTR-positive,\nprogressive panNET [ 70].

In these cases, treatment with octreotide LAR or lanreotide has\nquestionable antiproliferative effects [ 71]. Given its ORR of 39%, which increases to 55% in\npanNETs [ 29],177Lu-DOTATATE can be considered as ﬁrst-line therapy if response is clini-\ncally necessitated [ 72]. These response rates compare favorably to targeted therapy [ 73–75]\nand for panNETs appear similar to capecitabine–temozolomide chemotherapy [ 76]. Poorly\ndifferentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs) and well-differentiated grade 3 NETs\nare high-grade NENs that display a more aggressive biological behavior than the more\ncommon grade 1 and 2 NETs [ 77]. PRRT is currently not considered a standard treatment\noption for high-grade NENs [68,78]. The rate of SSTR 2expression in grade 3 NETs ranges\nfrom 67–92% and in NECs from 32–50%, compared to a positive expression rate in grade 1\nand 2 NETs ranging from 67–96% [ 5,79–82]. In a meta-analysis of PRRT comprising four\nstudies, grade 3 NET patients had a median PFS of 19 months and median OS of 44 months\nafter PRRT. The median PFS was 11 and 4 months and the median OS was 22 and 9 months\nfor NEC with a Ki-67 of 21–55% and NEC with a Ki-67 above 55%, respectively [ 83]. Recent\nstudies implicated that PRRT could be considered in grade 3 GEP-NETs and GEP-NEC\nwith a Ki-67 of 21–55%. Importantly, to qualify for PRRT, uptake in all lesions is required\non somatostatin receptor imaging [83].\n7. Eligibility Criteria for PRRT\nThere are several inclusion and exclusion criteria to decide if a patient is eligible for\ntreatment with PRRT. A key criterion for PRRT is the degree of uptake on SSTR imaging\nwhich is scored by the Krenning score based on planar111In-DTPA-octereotide imaging.\nIt was reported that68Ga-DOTA-SSA PET/CT results in higher Krenning scores than\n111In-DTPA-octereotide imaging [ 84]. The uptake of all tumor lesions should minimally\nbe equal to the physiological uptake in the liver (Krenning score grade 2) on111In-DTPA-\noctreotide scintigraphy or higher than the physiological uptake in the liver on68Ga-DOTA-\nSSA PET/CT for a patient to be eligible for PRRT. The latter functional imaging is more\naccurate for detecting SSTR-positive primary tumors and metastases and therefore su-\nperior for assessing the total extent of disease [ 85–87]. PRRT is only applicable for pa-\ntients with a Karnofsky Performance Scale of at least 60 [ 27]. PRRT is contra-indicated\nfor patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding, patients with severe cardiac impairment\n(NYHA III or IV) and those with a life expectancy less than 3 months [ 31]. Since PRRT\ncan induce toxicity, the following pre-treatment laboratory values are required: creatinine\nclearance > 40 mL/min, hemoglobin levels ≥6 mmol/L, leukocytes > 2 ×109/L, platelet\ncount > 75 ×109/L, bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) and aspartate aminotrans-\nferase (ASAT) < 3 times the upper limit of normal and albumin > 3 g/dL [2,3].\n8.', 'Lutetium-177- DOTATATE/\nDOTATOC for treatment of\nGastroenteropancreatic NETs\nNeuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) are relatively rare\nneoplasms which may arise from pluripotential stem cells in\naddition to cells of the diffuse neuroendocrine system\ncomprising the autonomic nervous system, the thyroid, lungs,\npancreas and gastrointestinal tract ( 2). The classi ﬁcation of NENs\nhas recently been updated by the WHO according to morphology\nand proliferation as well differentiated neuroendocrine tumors\n(NETs) (G1 to G3) and poorly differentiated neuroendocrine\ncarcinomas (NECs) (G3) ( Table 2 )(3).\nNETs may be clinically silent ( ‘non-functioning ’) or may\nsynthesize and secrete a variety of peptides and neuroamines\nwhich lead to the development of characteristic clinical\nsyndromes, including carcinoid syndrome and functional\npancreatic tumors such as insulinoma (hypoglycemia) and\ngastrinoma (gastric hyperacidity). The non-functioning tumors\ntend to present late with widespread metastatic disease,\nparticularly in the liver. NETss tend to be indolent in\ncharacter and patients can still live for relatively prolonged\nperiods with good quality of life even with metastatic disease ( 4).\nThe incidence of NENs is increasing year-on-year. In the\nUSA, the SEER database has documented a 6,4-fold increase in\nincidence between 2007 (1,09 per 100.000) and 2012 (6,98 per\n100.000) ( 5). This increase has included gastroenteropancreatic\n(GEP) NENs with the highest incidence being seen in adults\naged 74-80) ( 6) The age-standardized incidence rate of NENs in\nthe UK between 2013-2015 has been reported as 8.6 per 100,000,\nwith an incidence of 4.6 per 100,000 for gastroenteropancreatic\n(GEP) NENs ( 7).\nGEP-NETs are graded with increasing aggressivity as G1, G2\nor G3, based on Ki-67 labeling index, mitotic count and\nhistological differentiation ( Table 2 )(3). Well differentiated G1\nand G2 GEP-NETs typically show a slower progression and better\nprognosis than G3 GEP-NETs ( 8). A characteristic feature ofGEP-NETs is that a majority express functioning somatostatin\nreceptors (SSTRs) 2 and 5. This renders the tumors amenable to\ntreatment with synthetic somatostatin peptides, which can inhibit\nfunctional secretion and also stabilize tumor growth ( 9). These\nsynthetic peptides, conjugated with a chelator, can be ef ﬁciently\nradiolabeled with photon-, positron- or particle-emitting\nradionuclides. The expression of SSTR2 enables GEP-NETs to\nbe imaged with receptor targeted high resolution PET/CT(DOTATOC/DOTATATE-Ga-68). In addition, tumors can be\ntreated with therapeutic Lu-177 DOTATOC/DOTATATE ( 10).\nPatients with G1 and G2 GEP-NETS often present late, with\nmetastatic disease. Until recently, somatostatin analogues and\nthe molecularly targeted drugs Sunitinib andEverolimus as well\nas chemotherapy in PNETs have provided the mainstays of\ntreatment ( 11). These treatments usually result in disease\nstabilization for a limited period of time. In the RADIANT-3\ntrial, Everolimus achieved a progression free survival (PFS) of 11\nmonths in pancreatic NETS (PNETs) and a similar PFS was\nachieved in midgut and pulmonary NETs in the RADIANT-4\ntrial ( 12,13).\nPRRT has recently emerged as a novel treatment option for\npatients with G1 and G2 GEP-NETs.']",2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1.0,1.0,1.0,78

Clin. Med. 2021 ,10, 1267 2 of 15\n(SSTR). For many years, evidence of an anti-tumor effect of PRRT were only obtained from\nnon-randomized Phase II trials or retrospective studies. The NETTER-1 Phase III Random-\nized Trial finally validated this treatment option by confirming its low toxicity but also its\neffectiveness in tumor control. Following these results,177Lu-DOTATATE was approved by\nthe US Food and Drug Administration in 2018 and the European Medicines Agency in 2017\nfor the treatment of gastroenteropancreatic NETs that are well differentiated and obtain a\nprescription authorization in France in metastatic midgut NETs [ 2]. Some interesting data\nexist for pancreatic and pulmonary NETs. In this review, we discuss the clinical efficiency of\nPRRT in gastroenteropancreatic and pulmonary NETs.\n2. Somatostatin Receptors (SSTR) and Radio-Labelled Somatostatin Analogues\nEffect of PRRT is correlated with the ability for the markers to ﬁx the SSTR (SSTR1-5).\nThis therapy is therefore dedicated to NETs who strongly over expressed those receptors.\nSSTRs belong to a family of G-protein coupled receptors with seven transmembrane\ndomains. The majority of well differentiated gastroenteropancreatic and pulmonary NETs\nare characterized by the strong expression of SSTR, including SSTR2 Grade 1/2 NETs\nexpress the SSTR more often and at higher levels than grade 3 NETs. When linked to the\nreceptors, radiolabeled somatostatin analogues are internalized according to the normal\nrecycling dynamics of membrane receptors and the degradation products of peptides\nare stored in lysosomes, in intracellular, which allows for the release and retention of\nradioactivity inside tumor cells [ 3]. This mechanism accounts for the low toxicity of the\nPRRT on the healthy cells. Radiolabelled somatostatin analogs are made up of an isotope\nradionuclide, a carrier molecule (derived from octreotide), and a chelating agent that binds\nthem together and stabilizes the complex. The commonly used chelating agents are DOTA\n(DOTA acid and tetra-azacyclododecane-tetra-acetic) and DTPA (di-ethylenetriamine penta-\naceticacid). Three radionucleides (111In,90Y and177Lu) were conjugated to the somatostatin\nanalogues and their different physical characteristics confer speciﬁc advantages. The90Y\nand177Lu emit beta particles with higher energy and longer ranges, which translates into\ngreater therapeutic potential. Due to the emission of gamma rays, the177Lu can also be\nused for dosimetry and monitoring of tumor response [4].\n3. Modalities of Realization and Patients Selection\nPRRT is the single validated treatment option in the NETs, which for there is a pre-\ndictive marker of answer: the expression of SSTR. Response rates have been shown to\nbe increased in patients with a higher degree of absorption of radiotracers in the case of\n111In-pentetreotid scintigraphy An overall response rate of approximately 60% has been\nreported in patients with a grade 4 according to the Krenning score, corresponding to a tu-\nmor absorption greater than that of the spleen, and kidneys. Intense ﬁxation (SUV) greater\nthan 16 on the68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT is a predictive marker of high tumor response\n(sensitivity: 95%; specﬁcity: 60 %) [ 5] (Figure 1). The effectiveness of PRRT is correlated\nwith the tumor volume and the location of the primary tumor (amount of SSTR present\non the tumor cell) (Figure 2). Thus, NETs with high liver tumor volume are considered\nto be less sensitive to PRRT [ 6]. Similarly, it is suggested that pancreatic NETs frequently\nrespond to the PRRT but with an earlier progression than in midgut NETs. The treatment\nmodalities are relatively standardized in France with a treatment carried out by infusion\nof radiolabel split in four cycles spaced eight weeks apart.', 'If GEP-NETS are resectable, surgery is the primary ap-\nproach. Patients with unresectable metastatic disease usually\ngo through multiple lines of treatments including somatostatin\nanalogue (SSA) therapy or targeted therapy, such as everoli-mus (mTOR inhibitor) or sunitinib (tyrosine kinase inhibitor)\n[7]. In patients with grade 1 and 2 NETs (Ki-7 LI of up to\n20%) that are inoperable and metastatic, who have failed first-\nline somatostatin treatment, and whose tumors express high\nlevels of somatostatin receptors (SSTRs), peptide receptor ra-\ndionuclide therapy (PRRT) would be a viable option. PRRTusually involves DOTATOC, DOTATATE, and DOTANOC\nlabeled either with\n90Yor177Lu [7]. Patients included in study\nprotocols have positive NET histology and SSTR scintigraphy\nwith111In OctreoScan or68Ga PET-Dota-peptide (Fig. 1). A\npositive scan denotes lesion uptake that is equal to or greaterthan the liver uptake [ 8]. Important criteria to be taken into\naccount when considering PRRT include objective disease\nprogression, adequate blood profile (hemoglobin, white cell,\nand platelet count levels), creatinine, and ECOG performancescore ≤2[8]. A good performance status means the patient\nwould be self-sufficient and reduces the need for physicalassistance during the treatment period (3 days/cycle).Recently published European Society for Medical Oncology\n(ESMO) Clinical Practice Guidelines have recommended\nPRRT up to the upper limit of Ki-67 LI to 30% [ 9].\nScintigraphic or PET tomoscintigraphic evaluation is to datethe most accurate noninvasive method to identify and confirmthe overexpression of functioning receptors [ 10]. An impor-\ntant issue in the consideration of PRRT is that the somatostatinreceptors should be functional, i.e., able to internalize the re-ceptor analogue complex and retain the radioactivity inside\nthe cell. The critical issues for effective therapy are somato-\nstatin receptor overexpression and the evidence of functional-ity. The nuclear physician can calculate a tumor-to-liver ratio\nas a relative measure of receptor number [ 11]; this ratio must\nbe high for PRRT eligibility.Mechanism of Action and Constituents\nof Radiolabeled SSAs\nSomatostatin ’s actions include inhibiting hormone secretion,\nsuppressing the release of insulin-like growth factors,\ninhibiting angiogenesis, and inducing apoptosis in the tumor\ntissue [ 12]. Such biologic effects are mediated through inter-\naction with five subtypes of somatostatin receptors (SSTR1-\n5), which belong to the seven-transmembrane domain, G-\nprotein-coupled receptor superfamily. The currently approvedSSAs are octreotide and lanreotide, in slow-release formula-\ntions, long-acting release (LAR), and supersaturated solution\n(Autogel®).\nDue to the overexpression of SSTRs in NETs, which is\nestimated to be in around 80% of NETs, they are consideredsuitable targets for PRRT with radiolabeled SSA. Once boundto their receptor, radiolabeled SSAs are internalized as per\nnormal receptor recycling dynamics, and the breakdown prod-\nucts of the radiolabeled peptides are stored in lysosomes, thusenabling delivery and causing suspension of radioactivity in-\nside the tumor cell [ 13]. This would result in radiation-induced\nDNA damage of the tumor cell and its eventual death.\nRadiolabeled SSAs are made up of three main constituents;\na radionuclide isotope, a ligand or carrier molecule (TOC or\nTATE), and a chelator or linker (DOTA) that binds them to-\ngether and stabilizes the complex (Fig. 2). Chelators mainly\nused include DOTA (tetraazacyclododecane tetra-acetic acid)\nand DTPA (diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid), while\noctreotide and octreotate (TOC and TATE, respectively) are\ngenerally used as ligands [ 14]. The most known and studied\nSSA is octreotide.', '2.2. Clinical Studies and Approvals\nToday, PRRT with radiolabeled SST agonists (e.g., DOTA-TOC or DOTA-TATE, Table 1)\nis part of the standard of care of NENs. NETTER-1 (NCT01578239; EudraCT number\n2011-005049-11 ) was the ﬁrst prospective, open-label, randomized, phase III trial to com-\npare four cycles of177Lu-DOTA-TATE (4 ×7.4 GBq) plus 30 mg long-acting release oc-\ntreotide (PRRT group, n = 117) with high-dose (60 mg double dose) long-acting release\noctreotide (control group, n = 114) in advanced, progressive midgut NET patients. There\nwas a signiﬁcantly longer progression-free survival for the PRRT arm ( p< 0.001) [ 22]\nand a signiﬁcant improvement in quality of life [ 23]. Consequently,177Lu-DOTA-TATE\n(177Lu-oxodotreotide ) received marketing authorization for the treatment of adult patients\nwith SST-positive gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs). At the ﬁnal\nanalysis of overall survival (OS), the median OS was improved by 11.7 months for the\n177Lu-DOTA-TATE arm versus the control arm (48.0 (95% CI, 37.4–55.2) vs. 36.3 (95% CI,\n25.9–51.7) months, respectively), which, however, did not reach statistical signiﬁcance in the\nlong-term follow-up with a median of 6.3 years [ 24]. Regarding safety, the NETTER-1 data\nshow a low incidence of long-term side-effects regarding hematotoxicity and nephrotoxicity.\nCurrently , a second prospective, randomized, controlled, open-label, multi-center, phase\nIII trial, COMPETE (NCT03049189), is ongoing, in which PRRT using177Lu-DOTA-TOC\n(177Lu-edotreotide, four cycles with 7.5 GBq/cycle) is being compared with the mTOR\ninhibitor everolimus (10 mg daily) in patients with progressive, SST-positive GEP-NETs.\nUpon completion of the study, the approval of177Lu-DOTA-TOC is expected. These\ntrials and other trials (e.g., OCCLURANDOM, NCT02230176) should further precisely\ndetermine the position of PRRT in the current clinical algorithm with regard to other\nsystemic therapies, such as everolimus and sunitinib.\nUsing routes other than intravenous administration may be an interesting approach to\nenhance the therapeutic and safety window of PRRT. NENs and their liver metastases are\noften highly perfused, and the intra-arterial route can exploit the ﬁrst-pass effect to treat\nliver-dominant disease more efﬁciently. Such an approach can also be used for inoperable\nprimary tumors to downstage the disease in the neoadjuvant setting [ 25,26].

Neoadjuvant PRRT: PRRT can be used as neoadjuvant therapy in patients with inoperable pancreatic NETs, aiming for tumor shrinkage to make the tumor more amenable to surgery [Hirmas et al., 2018]. Several case reports and studies have shown successful surgical resection of pancreatic NETs after neoadjuvant PRRT with 90Y-DOTATATE or 177Lu-octreotate [Hirmas et al., 2018].

Adjuvant PRRT: PRRT may also be used in an adjuvant setting after surgery of GEP-NETs to prevent tumor growth after surgical manipulation or further growth of pre-existing micrometastases. However, there is limited evidence from studies on the best treatment approach for adjuvant PRRT [Hirmas et al., 2018].

Among 52 patients, they\nreport CR in 2%, PR 28%, SD 68%, and PD in only 2% of\npatients with median PFS 48 months.\nA recent randomized clinical trial by Ballal et al. [ 38]\nestablished clinical efficacy of177Lu-DOTATATE combina-\ntion with capecitabine over PRRT alone. According to\nRECIST 1.1 criteria, in the combination group, PR was\nachieved in 34%, SD in 50.2%, and PD in 6.8% of patients(compared to 6.3, 60.9, and 26.5% in the PRRT-only group,\nrespectively), and the combination group was shown to have\nlonger OS and PFS. No significant differences in hematolog-ical toxicity or hepatotoxicity were reported between both\ngroups.\nNeoadjuvant PRRT\nThe use of PRRT in patients with inoperable pNETs as neo-\nadjuvant therapy, targeting tumor shrinkage, and making it\nmore amenable to surgery is very promising. There are some\ncase reports describing the use of neoadjuvant PRRT, partic-ularly 90Y-DOTATATE in patients with pancreatic NETs who\ncould be operated on successfully after PRRT [ 39–42].\nEzzidin et al. [ 43] reported a patient with pNET and liver\nmetastases who received neoadjuvant therapy with\n177Lu-\noctreotate. There was a partial response with tumor shrinkage\nand a small residual metastatic liver lesion. The primary tumorwas then completely resected and the patient remained in CR\nlocally for 22 months postoperatively. Barber et al. [ 44]r e -\nported treating five patients with inoperable NETs with the\ncombination of\n177Lu-octreotate and 5-FU. One of them\nunderwent subsequent complete surgical resection andremained 12 months postoperatively alive and free of disease.\nVan Vliet and colleagues [ 45] studied 29 patients with a\npathology-proven nonfunctioning pNETs treated with\n177Lu-\noctreotate. After treatment, successful surgery was performedin nine patients (31%). The median PFS was 69 months for\npatients with successful surgery and 49 months for the other\npatients. Hence, neoadjuvant treatment with\n177Lu-octreotate\nis a valuable option for patients with initially unresectablepNETs.\nKwekkeboom et al. [ 46] retrospectively studied 310 patients\nwith pNETs who received treatment with\n177Lu-octreotate.\nFour patients with partially res ponding nonfunctioning pNETs\nwere able to undergo complete surgical resection. One of them\ndied postoperatively from surgi cal complications. Recently, a\nstudy abstract from the European Pancreatic Club (EPC) 2017meeting [ 47] compared patients with initially metastatic and/or\nlocally advanced pNETs who underwent neoadjuvant PRRT\nwith a group of patients who underwent upfront surgery.After PRRT, tumor size decreased from 59 to 50 mm, and the\nrate of curative resection was 65%. The 2-year progression-free\nsurvival rate was not significantly different between bothgroups (67% in neoadjuvant vs. 58% in control groups), but\nthere was a lower risk of pancreatic fistula in the neoadjuvant\ngroup (25 vs. 65%) with comparable rates of complications (45vs. 60%).', 'One of them\ndied postoperatively from surgi cal complications.

Both groups were treated with PRRT, either\n90Y-\nDOTATOC or177Lu-DOTATATE. The resection of the prima-\nry tumor was significantly associated with better PR or SDafter PRRT and longer median PFS and OS for operated ver-sus non-operated patients. In this study, only patients with\nsynchronous pNET and liver metastases treated with PRRT\nwere considered, excluding those who underwent primary tu-mor and liver surgery with radical intent. Patients affected by a\nG3 tumor according to the WHO 2010 classification and those\nwho had undergone PRRT at disease progression under so-matostatin analogs were excluded.\nEven though it did not cover surgery per se, one study [ 49]\ncompared patients who received PRRTwho had received priorchemo or radionuclide hepatic embolization (CRHE) with\nthose who did not have any prior history of such intervention.\nA total of 70% of patients who had CRHE (compared to56.5% who did not) experienced benefit from\n177Lu PRRT,\nand 21.6% who had CRHE (compared to 35.8% who did not)experienced progression.

More\ngenerally, PRRT is an attractive therapy option for delivering\ncytotoxic radiation to tumor ce lls through speciﬁc binding of a\nradiolabeled peptide to a molecular target. The development of\nimaging companions gave rise to the concept of radiotheranostics,\nimportant for in vivo tumor detection, characterization, and staging\nbut also, and more importantly, for individual patient selection and\ntreatment. The success of somatostatin receptor targeting paved\nthe way for the clinical translation of other peptide-based radio-\npharmaceuticals targeting, for example, the receptors cholecysto-\nkinin 2, gastrin-releasing peptide, neurokinin-1, and C-X-C motif\nchemokine 4. Although historically the Auger emitter111In and the\nhigh-energy β−emitter90Y were used, most PRRT are currently\nperformed with the medium-energy β−emitter177Lu, whereas α\nemitters are increasingly studied in various clinical applications.\nKey Words: targeted radionuclide therapy; theranostics; G-protein\ncoupled receptors; beta radiation therapy; alpha radiation therapy\nJ Nucl Med 2019; 60:167–171\nDOI: 10.2967/jnumed.118.213496\nP eptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) is part of the\nwider concept of targeted radionuclide therapy. PRRT delivers\ndestructive radiation to cancer cells via radiolabeled peptides able\nto bind speciﬁcally to peptide receptors expressed in higher den-\nsity on the tumor cell membrane than in nontumor tissues. This is\nthe case for many G-protein–coupled receptors, whose overex-\npression is linked to numerous human malignancies. Regulatory\npeptides targeting G-protein–coupled receptors are a rich source\nof vectors ( 1) that can be chemically tuned to transport radioac-\ntivity while preserving their receptor afﬁnity. PRRT is used in the\ntreatment of metastatic or unresectable cancers through systemic\nor, more occasionally, locoregional administration.\nThree types of radiation are used in PRRT: b2particles (elec-\ntrons), aparticles, and Auger electrons ( 2), with a strong focus on\nb2emitters (e.g.,177Lu and90Y). Because bparticles have a long\nrange in tissues (0.05–12 mm), neighboring cells around thetargeted cell are also irradiated (cross-ﬁre effect). This effect is\nconsidered ideal for targeting large tumors with a heterogeneous\ntarget distribution. In contrast, aparticles (e.g.,213Bi and225Ac)\nhave a very short range in tissues (20–100 mm), irradiating vol-\numes with cellular dimensions and therefore sparing normal sur-\nrounding tissues from cytotoxic radiation. Their linear energy\ntransfer is much higher than the one of b2particles (50–230 vs.\n0.2 keV/ mm), making aradiation far more cytotoxic. Finally,\nAuger emitters (e.g.,111In), having a very short range in tissue\n(,20mm, subcellular dimensions) and intermediate linear energy\ntransfer (4–25 keV/ mm), may be better suited for targeting micro-\nscopic disease (i.e., micrometastases), such as in the adjuvant set-\nting.

For many years, evidence of an anti-tumor effect of PRRT were only obtained from\nnon-randomized Phase II trials or retrospective studies. The NETTER-1 Phase III Random-\nized Trial finally validated this treatment option by confirming its low toxicity but also its\neffectiveness in tumor control. Following these results,177Lu-DOTATATE was approved by\nthe US Food and Drug Administration in 2018 and the European Medicines Agency in 2017\nfor the treatment of gastroenteropancreatic NETs that are well differentiated and obtain a\nprescription authorization in France in metastatic midgut NETs [ 2]. Some interesting data\nexist for pancreatic and pulmonary NETs. In this review, we discuss the clinical efficiency of\nPRRT in gastroenteropancreatic and pulmonary NETs.\n2. Somatostatin Receptors (SSTR) and Radio-Labelled Somatostatin Analogues\nEffect of PRRT is correlated with the ability for the markers to ﬁx the SSTR (SSTR1-5).\nThis therapy is therefore dedicated to NETs who strongly over expressed those receptors.\nSSTRs belong to a family of G-protein coupled receptors with seven transmembrane\ndomains. The majority of well differentiated gastroenteropancreatic and pulmonary NETs\nare characterized by the strong expression of SSTR, including SSTR2 Grade 1/2 NETs\nexpress the SSTR more often and at higher levels than grade 3 NETs. When linked to the\nreceptors, radiolabeled somatostatin analogues are internalized according to the normal\nrecycling dynamics of membrane receptors and the degradation products of peptides\nare stored in lysosomes, in intracellular, which allows for the release and retention of\nradioactivity inside tumor cells [ 3]. This mechanism accounts for the low toxicity of the\nPRRT on the healthy cells. Radiolabelled somatostatin analogs are made up of an isotope\nradionuclide, a carrier molecule (derived from octreotide), and a chelating agent that binds\nthem together and stabilizes the complex. The commonly used chelating agents are DOTA\n(DOTA acid and tetra-azacyclododecane-tetra-acetic) and DTPA (di-ethylenetriamine penta-\naceticacid). Three radionucleides (111In,90Y and177Lu) were conjugated to the somatostatin\nanalogues and their different physical characteristics confer speciﬁc advantages. The90Y\nand177Lu emit beta particles with higher energy and longer ranges, which translates into\ngreater therapeutic potential. Due to the emission of gamma rays, the177Lu can also be\nused for dosimetry and monitoring of tumor response [4].\n3. Modalities of Realization and Patients Selection\nPRRT is the single validated treatment option in the NETs, which for there is a pre-\ndictive marker of answer: the expression of SSTR. Response rates have been shown to\nbe increased in patients with a higher degree of absorption of radiotracers in the case of\n111In-pentetreotid scintigraphy An overall response rate of approximately 60% has been\nreported in patients with a grade 4 according to the Krenning score, corresponding to a tu-\nmor absorption greater than that of the spleen, and kidneys. Intense ﬁxation (SUV) greater\nthan 16 on the68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT is a predictive marker of high tumor response\n(sensitivity: 95%; specﬁcity: 60 %) [ 5] (Figure 1). The effectiveness of PRRT is correlated\nwith the tumor volume and the location of the primary tumor (amount of SSTR present\non the tumor cell) (Figure 2). Thus, NETs with high liver tumor volume are considered\nto be less sensitive to PRRT [ 6]. Similarly, it is suggested that pancreatic NETs frequently\nrespond to the PRRT but with an earlier progression than in midgut NETs. The treatment\nmodalities are relatively standardized in France with a treatment carried out by infusion\nof radiolabel split in four cycles spaced eight weeks apart.', 'Symptomatic relief was encountered in this therapy in patients\nwith metastasized GEP-NETs. However, objective tumor re-sponses were rare [ 15,16].

Different studies report median progression-free survival (PFS) varying from 17 to 29 months and medianoverall survival (OS) from 22 to 37 months [ 21–24].\n177Lu-DOTATATE is currently the most widely used\nradiopeptide for PRRT [ 21]. It has shown similar efficacy\nwhen compared to90Y-DOTATOC, while showing a more\nfavorable toxicity profile, especially when speaking of hema-\ntological and renal toxicity [ 25,26]. In a recent study on bron-\nchial and GEP-NETs, Brabander et al. [ 27] evaluated safety,\nefficacy and toxicity of177Lu-DOTATATE and showed im-\npressive results. The objective response rate (ORR) reached\n39%, stable disease (SD) was reported in 43% of patients, andthe PFS and OS for all NET patients were 29 and 63 months,\nrespectively (Fig. 3).\nWith time, the use of PRRT which initially targeted\nNETs was extended to other types of confirmed SSTR-positive tumors. Tumors such as breast cancer, lymphoma,\nglioma, meningioma, and paraganglioma, as well as non-\niodine-absorbing differentiated thyroid cancer can now be\nconsidered for PRRT when registered therapies have failed[8].\n177Lu Radionuclide and NETTER-1 Trial\nThe Neuroendocrine Tumors Therapy (NETTER-1) trial is thefirst randomized controlled trial that evaluated the efficacy\nFig. 1 aMIP image of68Ga\nDOTATOC PET shows the\nprimary NET in the small bowel\non the right side of the abdomen\n(red arrow) with extensive livermetastases, both demonstratingintense increased radiotracer\nuptake reflecting the high\nexpression of the somatostatinreceptors.

At patient discharge, the radiation exposure should be\nmeasured and patients should receive tailored advice on the duration of radiation safety\nprecautions at home, to avoid a high radiation exposure to other people, particularly children\nand pregnant women. Patients with NET-associated hormonal syndromes who have an\nindication for continuation of SSA use should adjust the moment of the injections to the\nPRRT cycles. Long-acting SSA should not be given within 4–6 weeks before a cycle of PRRT\nbecause of interference with the radiolabeled SSA. Although there is conflicting evidence\nfrom two limited single center studies whether continuation of SSA treatment is beneficial in\nnon-functioning NETs [ 63,64], this practice is often adopted. If the patient suffers from severe\nhormonal symptoms, short-acting SSA can be used to bridge this period up till 24 h before\nPRRT. Radiopharmaceuticals such as177Lu-DOTATATE need to be administered at specialized\nfacilities by medical personnel trained in radiation safety. These facilities should adhere to\nnational and international regulations on the use of radiopharmaceuticals and be licensed by\nthe regulatory authorities. Depending on local protocol and exposure regulations, PRRT with\n177Lu-DOTATATE can be given in an in-patient as well as an out-patient setting. In between\ncycles, patients should be reviewed for adverse effects, including full blood count and renal\nand liver function. Response evaluation by cross-sectional imaging is usually performed 2–3\nand 6 months after the last cycle of PRRT. Long-term follow-up is determined on an individual\nbasis taking into account the tumor biology and therapeutic response [ 65]. Pseudo-progression\nis a phenomenon that should be considered in the response evaluation when an increase in\ntumor size is seen during or short after treatment with PRRT. Pseudo-progression is probably\nbased on localized, temporarily edema caused by inflammation as a response to PRRT and\ndoes not show the actual tumor response to the therapy [ 58]. When pseudo-progression is\nsuspected, functional imaging (for example, PET/CT) can help differentiate between true\nprogression and pseudo-progression [31].\n5. Salvage PRRT\nIn NET patients who showed tumor response at least 18 months after the first cycle of\n177Lu-DOTATATE, re-treatment with PRRT (R-PRRT) with two additional cycles of 7.4 GBq\neach after renewed PD has shown antitumoral effects. In a meta-analysis on the effect of\nR-PRRT, the pooled median PFS was 14 months with a pooled median OS of 27 months.\nSimilarly, the pooled ORR was 17% with a disease control rate of 77%. Response rates,\nPFS and OS were lower than for initial PRRT [ 66], nonetheless R-PRRT remains a potential\noption for GEP-NET patients when other systemic treatment options are limited. The limited\nefficacy of R-PRRT as compared to initial PRRT might be explained by the administration\nof lower cumulative activity (i.e., generally half of the initial PRRT dosage) [ 51], the increase\nin tumor bulk at baseline before R-PRRT and potential changes in the tumor biology, such\nas a longitudinal increase in Ki-67. In the largest study to date by van der Zwan et al., no\ndifference in toxicity after R-PRRT as compared with initial PRRT was observed, particularly\nno increased occurrence of nephrotoxicity or significant hematological disease [ 67]. In cases\nwhere R-PRRT has provided additional benefit on tumor response and prolonged PFS, further\nre-treatment at the time of progression can be considered [67].\n6. Patient Selection\nPRRT with177Lu-DOTATATE is registered for patients with GEP-NETs that are pro-\ngressive on SSA treatment.', 'PRRT is only applicable for pa-\ntients with a Karnofsky Performance Scale of at least 60 [ 27]. PRRT is contra-indicated\nfor patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding, patients with severe cardiac impairment\n(NYHA III or IV) and those with a life expectancy less than 3 months [ 31]. Since PRRT\ncan induce toxicity, the following pre-treatment laboratory values are required: creatinine\nclearance > 40 mL/min, hemoglobin levels ≥6 mmol/L, leukocytes > 2 ×109/L, platelet\ncount > 75 ×109/L, bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) and aspartate aminotrans-\nferase (ASAT) < 3 times the upper limit of normal and albumin > 3 g/dL [2,3].\n8. PRRT-Related Toxicity\nAdverse events related to PRRT are frequently mild and include nausea, abdominal pain\nand asthenia [ 27,50]. Increased hair loss is observed in up to 60% of patients treated with\n177Lu-DOTATATE, but this is temporary and seldom leads to baldness [ 88]. Besides these\nmild adverse events, PRRT can induce more severe toxicities which can be dose-limiting and\nadjustments to the treatment schedule might be required [ 89]. When the toxicity has subsided\nwithin 16 weeks after the last dose, guidelines advise to administer half of the original activity\nof177Lu-DOTATATE during the next cycle. PRRT should be discontinued when the toxicity\npersists after 16 weeks or recurs after the half dose [ 3]. In the NETTER-1 trial, 7% of the\npatients received a reduced dose because of dose-limiting toxicities [ 27]. The kidneys and the\nbone marrow are the critical organs for dose-limiting toxicities.', 'Cancers 2022 ,14, 5792 7 of 17\ncompared to 11.0 months for sunitinib treatment in patients with advanced, SSTR-positive,\nprogressive panNET [ 70]. Currently, the randomized phase III COMPETE trial is comparing\nPRRT with177Lu-edotreotide with everolimus in advanced, progressive GEP-NET patients.\nA subset of GEP-NET patients present with extensive tumor bulk or high proliferative rate\n(Ki-67 index of 10–55%). In these cases, treatment with octreotide LAR or lanreotide has\nquestionable antiproliferative effects [ 71]. Given its ORR of 39%, which increases to 55% in\npanNETs [ 29],177Lu-DOTATATE can be considered as ﬁrst-line therapy if response is clini-\ncally necessitated [ 72]. These response rates compare favorably to targeted therapy [ 73–75]\nand for panNETs appear similar to capecitabine–temozolomide chemotherapy [ 76]. Poorly\ndifferentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs) and well-differentiated grade 3 NETs\nare high-grade NENs that display a more aggressive biological behavior than the more\ncommon grade 1 and 2 NETs [ 77]. PRRT is currently not considered a standard treatment\noption for high-grade NENs [68,78]. The rate of SSTR 2expression in grade 3 NETs ranges\nfrom 67–92% and in NECs from 32–50%, compared to a positive expression rate in grade 1\nand 2 NETs ranging from 67–96% [ 5,79–82]. In a meta-analysis of PRRT comprising four\nstudies, grade 3 NET patients had a median PFS of 19 months and median OS of 44 months\nafter PRRT. The median PFS was 11 and 4 months and the median OS was 22 and 9 months\nfor NEC with a Ki-67 of 21–55% and NEC with a Ki-67 above 55%, respectively [ 83]. Recent\nstudies implicated that PRRT could be considered in grade 3 GEP-NETs and GEP-NEC\nwith a Ki-67 of 21–55%. Importantly, to qualify for PRRT, uptake in all lesions is required\non somatostatin receptor imaging [83].\n7. Eligibility Criteria for PRRT\nThere are several inclusion and exclusion criteria to decide if a patient is eligible for\ntreatment with PRRT. A key criterion for PRRT is the degree of uptake on SSTR imaging\nwhich is scored by the Krenning score based on planar111In-DTPA-octereotide imaging.\nIt was reported that68Ga-DOTA-SSA PET/CT results in higher Krenning scores than\n111In-DTPA-octereotide imaging [ 84]. The uptake of all tumor lesions should minimally\nbe equal to the physiological uptake in the liver (Krenning score grade 2) on111In-DTPA-\noctreotide scintigraphy or higher than the physiological uptake in the liver on68Ga-DOTA-\nSSA PET/CT for a patient to be eligible for PRRT. The latter functional imaging is more\naccurate for detecting SSTR-positive primary tumors and metastases and therefore su-\nperior for assessing the total extent of disease [ 85–87]. PRRT is only applicable for pa-\ntients with a Karnofsky Performance Scale of at least 60 [ 27]. PRRT is contra-indicated\nfor patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding, patients with severe cardiac impairment\n(NYHA III or IV) and those with a life expectancy less than 3 months [ 31]. Since PRRT\ncan induce toxicity, the following pre-treatment laboratory values are required: creatinine\nclearance > 40 mL/min, hemoglobin levels ≥6 mmol/L, leukocytes > 2 ×109/L, platelet\ncount > 75 ×109/L, bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) and aspartate aminotrans-\nferase (ASAT) < 3 times the upper limit of normal and albumin > 3 g/dL [2,3].\n8.']",3.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0,1.0,1.0,1.0,112

Patient Selection\nPRRT with177Lu-DOTATATE is registered for patients with GEP-NETs that are pro-\ngressive on SSA treatment.', 'The patients were divided into two groups: PRRT monotherapy ( n=81, group 1) and PRRT\nplus SSA ( n=87, group 2). The results showed a higher median PFS (48 months) in the subgroup\nreceiving the combination therapy, compared to the subgroup receiving only PRRT (27 months) [ 95].\nAccordingly, di ﬀerent experimental approaches and strategies are being explored in order to optimize\nthe eﬀectiveness of PRRT and to minimize potential side e ﬀects. First of all, after completing four\ncycles of PRRT, treatment may even be continued, depending on kidney and bone marrow tolerance,\ne.g., with reduced radioactivity as part of a salvage therapy (Re-PRRT) [ 96]. Van der Zwan et al.\ndemonstrated that a cumulative dose of up to 60.5 GBq salvage PRRT with 177Lu-DOTATATE is safe\nand e ﬀective in patients with progressive disease (relapse-PD) after four cycles of 177Lu-DOTATATE\nPRRT [ 97]. Furthermore, no increasing incidence of acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic\nsyndrome was observed, and no grade III or IV nephrotoxicity occurred [ 97]. Further intensiﬁcation\nof the PRRT might be even achieved by administration of the tracer directly into the hepatic artery.\nIn particular, patients with hepatic dominant metastases would beneﬁt from this approach due to\nan increase of uptake of the radiopharmaceutical (the so-called “ﬁrst-pass” e ﬀect) [ 98]. The PRRT is\nbecoming increasingly important in a neoadjuvant setting [ 99]. In patients with inoperable P-NET\nand distant (metastatic) disease, PRRT was associated with a signiﬁcant reduction in tumor size, and\nthe tumor was rendered operable [ 100]. In such cases, complete response can be achieved. Figure 1\ndemonstrates a representative case of PRRT in a neoadjuvant setting.', 'In the largest study to date by van der Zwan et al., no\ndifference in toxicity after R-PRRT as compared with initial PRRT was observed, particularly\nno increased occurrence of nephrotoxicity or significant hematological disease [ 67].

Currently, the randomized phase III COMPETE trial is comparing\nPRRT with177Lu-edotreotide with everolimus in advanced, progressive GEP-NET patients.\nA subset of GEP-NET patients present with extensive tumor bulk or high proliferative rate\n(Ki-67 index of 10–55%). In these cases, treatment with octreotide LAR or lanreotide has\nquestionable antiproliferative effects [ 71]. Given its ORR of 39%, which increases to 55% in\npanNETs [ 29],177Lu-DOTATATE can be considered as ﬁrst-line therapy if response is clini-\ncally necessitated [ 72]. These response rates compare favorably to targeted therapy [ 73–75]\nand for panNETs appear similar to capecitabine–temozolomide chemotherapy [ 76]. Poorly\ndifferentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs) and well-differentiated grade 3 NETs\nare high-grade NENs that display a more aggressive biological behavior than the more\ncommon grade 1 and 2 NETs [ 77]. PRRT is currently not considered a standard treatment\noption for high-grade NENs [68,78]. The rate of SSTR 2expression in grade 3 NETs ranges\nfrom 67–92% and in NECs from 32–50%, compared to a positive expression rate in grade 1\nand 2 NETs ranging from 67–96% [ 5,79–82]. In a meta-analysis of PRRT comprising four\nstudies, grade 3 NET patients had a median PFS of 19 months and median OS of 44 months\nafter PRRT. The median PFS was 11 and 4 months and the median OS was 22 and 9 months\nfor NEC with a Ki-67 of 21–55% and NEC with a Ki-67 above 55%, respectively [ 83]. Recent\nstudies implicated that PRRT could be considered in grade 3 GEP-NETs and GEP-NEC\nwith a Ki-67 of 21–55%. Importantly, to qualify for PRRT, uptake in all lesions is required\non somatostatin receptor imaging [83].\n7. Eligibility Criteria for PRRT\nThere are several inclusion and exclusion criteria to decide if a patient is eligible for\ntreatment with PRRT. A key criterion for PRRT is the degree of uptake on SSTR imaging\nwhich is scored by the Krenning score based on planar111In-DTPA-octereotide imaging.\nIt was reported that68Ga-DOTA-SSA PET/CT results in higher Krenning scores than\n111In-DTPA-octereotide imaging [ 84]. The uptake of all tumor lesions should minimally\nbe equal to the physiological uptake in the liver (Krenning score grade 2) on111In-DTPA-\noctreotide scintigraphy or higher than the physiological uptake in the liver on68Ga-DOTA-\nSSA PET/CT for a patient to be eligible for PRRT. The latter functional imaging is more\naccurate for detecting SSTR-positive primary tumors and metastases and therefore su-\nperior for assessing the total extent of disease [ 85–87]. PRRT is only applicable for pa-\ntients with a Karnofsky Performance Scale of at least 60 [ 27]. PRRT is contra-indicated\nfor patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding, patients with severe cardiac impairment\n(NYHA III or IV) and those with a life expectancy less than 3 months [ 31]. Since PRRT\ncan induce toxicity, the following pre-treatment laboratory values are required: creatinine\nclearance > 40 mL/min, hemoglobin levels ≥6 mmol/L, leukocytes > 2 ×109/L, platelet\ncount > 75 ×109/L, bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) and aspartate aminotrans-\nferase (ASAT) < 3 times the upper limit of normal and albumin > 3 g/dL [2,3].\n8.']",1.0,0.6666666666666666,0.0,1.0,1,1.0,0.0,0.5,46

With the perspective of several years of clinical use,\nPRRT with90Y-labeled somatostatin analogs appears to be well-tolerated with favorable long-term\noutcome.', '19 I.9 Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy  Including surgery and external radiation therapy, there is often no curative treatment available for a large group of patients with disseminated carcinomas. Radionuclide therapy represents an interesting (complementary) option to current treatment modalities because it permits the delivery of a high dose of therapeutic radiation to cancer cells while minimizing exposure of normal cells (143). Due to the fundamental linkage of the CXCR4/CXCL12 axis to cancer progression and metastasis, the CXCR4 receptor holds great potential for targeted radionuclide therapy. The specific activity of the peptide should be as high as possible to reach the maximal achievable absorbed dose in the tumor. Since radionuclide-conjugated peptides are administered in low mass amounts, unwanted side effects like the mobilization of stem cells in the case of CXCR4-targeting peptides are very unlikely to occur whereas ionizing irradiation is effectively delivered to the target. Before treatment, peptides can be radiolabeled with diagnostic radionuclides to identify receptor-positive tumor lesions, for treatment planning, and also dosimetry. Exchange to a therapeutic radionuclide, often by using the same peptide-conjugate, enables targeted radionuclide therapy. DOTATATE for instance has been labeled with different radionuclides for diagnosis (mainly 111In and 68Ga) and also treatment (mainly 177Lu and 90Y) of neuroendocrine tumors (144-146).  The decay properties of radionuclides, e.g. β- or α emission, emission energy, linear energy transfer (LET), and half-life are important characteristics for diagnosis and therapy and can be chosen individually, depending on the type of the tumor, its size, intratumoral distribution (i.e. degree of heterogeneity of radionuclide deposition), pharmacokinetics, and other factors. 177Lu for instance (β-, Emax 0.5 MeV, tissue rangemax 2 mm (144,147) is more appropriate for smaller tumors, while 90Y (β-, Emax 2.3 MeV, tissue rangemax 12 mm (144,147), may be beneficial for larger lesions with heterogeneous receptor expression (144,147,148). Compared to β-particles (LET: 0.1-1 keV/µm) and γ irradiation, the local density of ionizations along a track of α-particles is considerably higher because multiple ionizations  (60-230 keV/µm) occur in the immediate vicinity of the decay site (149). Hence, α-particle emitters can be beneficial to target single cancer cells, i.e. micro-metastases, which are difficult to treat by currently employed techniques (150). Moreover, the high specific ionization of α-emitters causes a higher fraction of double strand breaks and can break radio- and chemoresistance (151). Furthermore, cell death due to α-irradiation is minimally dependent on tumor oxygenation, which means that cells are killed effectively even in hypoxic areas of the tumor (152,153). Accordingly, the therapeutic potential of α-emitters like 211At, 213Bi, and 225Ac have been investigated in some early stage clinical trials (149,150,154).

Akute Nebenwirkungen wie Übelkeit und Erbrechen sind meist mild und selbstlimitierend. Sie hängen oft mit der gleichzeitigen Gabe von nierenprotektiven Aminosäuren zusammen [2].

Subakute Nebenwirkungen treten innerhalb von 4-6 Wochen nach der Therapie auf, am häufigsten eine meist milde und reversible Knochenmarksuppression. Schwerwiegendere hämatologische Toxizität (WHO Grad 3-4) tritt bei weniger als 15% der Patienten auf [2].

Langfristige Nebenwirkungen können Nierenversagen sowie in seltenen Fällen Leukämie oder myelodysplastische Syndrome sein [1,2]. Das Risiko für schwere Nephrotoxizität (Grad 3/4) wurde bei nur 1,5% der Patienten beobachtet [1]. Durch Nierenprotektion mit Aminosäuren lässt sich die Nierentoxizität reduzieren [2].

Insgesamt ist die PRRT eine relativ sichere Therapie, solange die nötigen Vorsichtsmaßnahmen getroffen werden. Schwerwiegende Nebenwirkungen sind selten, die meisten Nebenwirkungen sind vorübergehend und beherrschbar.","['J. Clin. Med. 2021 ,10, 1267 11 of 15\n4.5.1. Subacute Effects\nPRRT is overall well tolerated with most patients experiencing only moderate toxicity.\nIn the study NETTER-1, validating the PRRT in midgut NETs, 5% of the patients discon-\ntinued treatment due to toxicity related to PRRT. Acute side effects are mainly nausea,\nvomiting, fatigue and abdominal pain. These adverse events are mainly caused by the\nsimultaneous infusion of aminoacids. Particular vigilance must be exercised with regard\nto the risk of carcinoid crisis. This event was reported in a very small minority (1%) of\npatients who received an PRRT treatment. This crisis usually appears within 48 h of the ﬁrst\ninfusion and is related to the massive release of active amines [ 34]. A myelosuppressure\nhas been described and is caused by the irradiation of the bone marrow. Bone marrow\nis particularly radiosensitive, and this toxicity does not appear to be associated to the\nexpression of SSTRs in myeloid cells. Myelosuppression generally develops four at six\nweeks after the infusion, is usually grade 1/2 and is reversible. Hematotoxic effects grade\n3 and 4 have been described in 13% and 10% of the patients receiving90Y-DOTATOC\nand177Lu-DOTATATE, respectively [ 35]. Lymphopenia is the more often reported severe\ncytopenia. Some studies have also reported that PRRT could be safely used in the case\nof diffuse metastatic bone marrow involvement, without irreversible myelosuppression,\nalthough a higher incidence of subacute transient hematologic toxicity was observed [36]\nOther toxicities have been reported, including a risk of hepatotoxicity in the patients\nwith major liver involvement. Thus, as indicated above, it is desirable to consider PRRT\nearly in the management process of the disease.\n4.5.2. Long-Term Effects\nLong-term side effects of PRRT can include renal failure and leukemic or myelodys-\nplastic syndromes.\nThe radiolabels are reabsorbed in the proximal tubules, may accumulate in the proxi-\nmal tubules in the renal interstitium and cause kidney damage. Because of its higher energy\nand longer penetration range,90Y irradiates the renal interstitium glomeruli more exten-\nsively than177Lu. In a large institutional series of 1109 patients treated with90Y-DOTATOC,\n103 patients (9%) were treated with90Y-DOTATOC with severe renal toxicity [ 7]. Nowa-\ndays, the concomitant administration positively charged aminoacids results in a reduction\nof up to 40% of the renal absorption. Despite renal protection, the median decrease of the\ncreatinine clearance is estimated to 4% per year in patients treated with177Lu-DOTATATE.\nThe risk factors for nephrotoxicity cited are diabetes and poorly controlled hypertension.\nRisk of severe nephrotoxicity (grade 3/4) was observed in only 1.5% of patients [ 37]. In\noverall, end-stage renal disease as a consequence of PRRT is extremely rare.\nCases of leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes have been reported as late-onset\nPRRT toxicity, with an estimated incidence of up to 2% [ 37,38]. Age over 70 years, cytopenia\nbefore treatment, the presence of bones metastasis, the high number of previous treatments,\nthe prior use of an alkylating agent and the radiotherapy increases the risk of secondary\nmyelodysplastic syndrome. Brieau et al. reported in a retrospective monocentric study\nconducted in a population of patients treated with PRRT and pre-treatment alkylating\nchemotherapy an increased risk late hematologic toxicity (20%; four patients out of 20) [ 39].\nThe main alkylating agent used in the NET treatment is temozolomide. The development\nof myelodysplastic syndrome or leukemia has been reported between 30 and 70 months\nafter treatment with PRRT [ 39].', 'during the first courses of therapy following the injection of\n177Lu-DOTATATE.\nSide effects\nAcute\nSide effects of PRRNT are usually mild, if necessary precau-\ntions are taken. Side effects may be acute, related to the\nadministration of amino acids or to the radiopeptide itself, or\nchronic. The coinfusion of amino acids enlarges the safetymargin for treating with higher activities enabling higher\ntumour radiation doses to be attained safely. Side effects such\nas nausea, headache and rarely vomiting due to metabolicacidosis induced by the amino acid coadministration do occur\nin the majority of patients [ 59,88]. Particular attention and\ncare should be given to avoiding possible electrolyte imbal-ance (hyperkalaemia, hypernatraemia), and the subsequent\nmetabolic acidosis, that might lead to mild nausea and vomit-\ning. The latter side effects should be managed by hydrating thepatient with normal saline and possibly by repeating cortico-\nsteroid or antiemetic administrations.\nPRRNT may exacerbate the syndromes related to the re-\nspective functional tumours, due to the sudden massive re-\nlease of the hormones and receptor stimulation. The clinical\nmanifestation is dependent on the specific hormone involved.The following measures are therefore recommended. Vital\nsigns (at least blood pressure and pulse) should be monitored\nbefore and after radiopeptide infusion, especially in symptom-atic patients. Therapeutic interventions should be undertaken\nto treat the for functional syndrome effects or exacerbation\n(e.g. carcinoid syndrome/hypotension, hypoglycaemia, hyper-gastrinaemia, hypertension, hypotension, WDHA syndrome,\nelectrolyte imbalance) [ 89]. In patients without or with minor\nmetastatic liver involvement, no significant hepatic toxicity\nhas been reported. However, in patients with massive liver\nmetastases and impaired liver function, liver toxicity mayoccur, and this should be considered, along with preexisting\nconditions affecting the liver, when choosing the appropriate\nradioisotope and dosing. In such cases,\n177Lu-labelled pepti-\nd e ss h o u l db eu s e da n dt h ea d m i n i s t e r e da c t i v i t ys h o u l db e\nreduced accordingly. After treatment, patients should avoid\npregnancy for at least 6 months. Due to a temporary impair-ment of fertility, related to a transient damage to Sertoli cells,\nmale patients should consider sperm banking before therapy.\nDelayed side effects\nRenal toxicityThe kidneys are the dose-limiting organs at the activities\nnormally reached with PRRNT. Proper kidney protection, asdiscussed, is currently mandatory. However, despite kidney\nprotection, loss of kidney function can occur after PRRNT,\nwith a creatinine clearance loss of about 3.8 % per year for\n177Lu-DOTATATE and 7.3 % per year for90Y-DOTATOC\n[90]. In a series of 1,109 patients treated with90Y-DOTATOC,\nthe incidence of grade 4 and 5 kidney toxicity was found to be9.2 % [ 50]. Delayed renal toxicity following\n90Y-DOTATOC\ntreatment was observed more frequently in patients with pre-\ndisposing risk factors including longstanding and poorly con-trolled hypertension and diabetes mellitus [ 56].\nBone marrow toxicitySevere (grade 3 and 4), mostly reversible, acute bone mar-\nrow toxicity is observed in less than 10 –13 % of treatment\ncycles with\n90Y-DOTATOC, and in 2 –3 % of cycles with\n177Lu-DOTATATE. Nevertheless, sporadic cases of myelo-\ndysplastic syndrome or overt acute myelogenous leukaemiahave been reported [ 45,49,50].\nEndocrine systemsDespite the presence of sstr in normal pituitary, thyroid and\nadrenal glands and Langerhans cells, no significant alterationin endocrine hormone function have been reported [ 91].\nResults\nPRRNT with the somatostatin analogues\n90Y-DOTATOC\nand177Lu-DOTATATE has been explored in NET for more\nthan a decade.', 'Salvage Treatment\nAlthough tumor response rates after initial treatment with\nPRRT are encouraging, CR is rare and eventually tumor pro-\ngression occurs in the majority of patients. Retreatment with\nextra cycles of PRRT as salvage therapy may be consideredwhen better options are not available. One study showed that\nsalvage therapy with two additional cycles of\n177Lu-octreotate\ndoes not lead to serious hematologic or nephrotoxic side ef-\nfects, but the tumor response rate was less compared with\ninitial treatment [ 50].\nAnother report showed that long PFS after the initial treat-\nment with PRRT predicts a prolonged PFS after salvage ther-apy [ 51], and argued that PRRT with\n177Lu-octreotate in the\nretreatment setting is a safe and effective option in patients\nwith metastatic GEP-NETs. For these reasons, retreatment\nseems a good option for patients who responded well after\nthe initial cycles of PRRT [ 52]. This novel and important\nconcept of salvage therapy of NET needs to be tested in large,\nprospective, and multi-center trials to contribute to evidence-\nbased findings.\nTreatment Side Effects\nPRRT is generally well-tolerated. Side effects can be divided to\nacute, subacute, and long-term side effects, as summarized inTable 4. Acute side effects are usually mild and self-limiting.\nNausea or vomiting are related to the concomitant admin-\nistration of kidney-protective amino acids. Subacute side\neffects are related to the radiopeptide itself, such as bonemarrow suppression, mild hair loss (observed with\n177Lu-\noctreotate), or, more rarely, an exacerbation of a clinicalsyndrome. The most common subacute side effect ofPRRT, occurring within 4 to 6 weeks after therapy, is bone\nmarrow suppression. Usually, the hematologic toxicity is\nmild and reversible. More serious WHO grade 3 or 4 tox-icity may occur, but this has been seen in less than 15% of\npatients [ 53].\nLong-term side effects of PRRT may include renal failure\nas well as leukemia/myelody splastic syndromes (MDS).\nBecause radiopeptides are usually reabsorbed in the proximal\ntubules, they can accumulate in the renal interstitium and in-duce inflammation and fibrosis with eventual kidney damage.\nCo-administration of positively charged amino acids results ina reduction of renal radioactive uptake, up to 40% as reportedin some studies [ 16,54]. If patients have long-standing or\npoorly controlled comorbidities such as diabetes and hyper-\ntension that affect kidney function, it is expected that there\nwould be a larger and more persistent decline in creatinine\nclearance [ 55].\nAdministration of Treatment\nFor purposes of kidney protection, positively charged amino\nacids, such as L-lysine and/or L-arginine, are co-infused to\ncompetitively inhibit the proximal tubular reabsorption ofthe radiopeptide [ 56]. This reduces the renal-absorbed dose.\nDilution of the amino acids with saline allows proper hydra-tion for the patient, an appropriate ratio to use is 25 g of aminoacid in 1 L of normal saline. Obviously, patients ’comorbidi-\nties should be taken into account (e.g., avoid volume overloadin patients with cardiac insufficiency and take care in avoidingelectrolyte imbalances with hyperosmotic solutions).\nAntiemetics can be administered before the infusion to avoidpotential nausea or vomiting. Amino acid infusion should bestarted 30 –60 min before administration of the radiopeptide\nand should be maintained over 4 h. Several amino acid pro-tective schemes have been proposed in the joint IAEA,EANM, and SNMMI practical guidelines on PRRT treatment\nof NETs [ 56].\nCurrent administration schedules comprise the most ap-\npropriate number of cycles (generally four or five) and thebest delivery frequency (8 weeks apart). This pattern allows\nthe patient to recover from the mild side effects of the ther-apy and increases its effectiveness in terms of the radiobi-\nological activity [ 57]. Radioisotope infusion should be\naround 30 min as recommended in the literature.']",4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1.0,1.0,1.0,139
8E advanced RAG,Is PRRT harmful for the patient?,english,specific,side effects,claude-3-opus-20240229 advanced RAG,"According to the provided context, PRRT can induce some harmful effects for the patient, although most adverse events are mild and reversible [1,2]. The main toxicities associated with PRRT are:

1. Hematological toxicity: Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, or leukopenia have been observed in a small percentage of patients. There is also a long-term risk of 2% for developing myelodysplastic syndrome and 1% for acute myeloid leukemia after PRRT [2].

2. Nephrotoxicity: Despite the use of lysine and arginine to reduce renal re-absorption of radiolabeled peptides, nephrotoxicity can still occur, such as tubulointerstitial scarring, atrophy, and thrombotic microangiopathy. In the NETTER-1 study, grade ≥3 renal toxicity was observed in 5% of the 177Lu-DOTATATE group [2].

3. Other side effects: Nausea, abdominal pain, asthenia, and increased hair loss are frequently reported but are usually mild [1,2].

PRRT is contra-indicated\nfor patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding, patients with severe cardiac impairment\n(NYHA III or IV) and those with a life expectancy less than 3 months [ 31]. Since PRRT\ncan induce toxicity, the following pre-treatment laboratory values are required: creatinine\nclearance > 40 mL/min, hemoglobin levels ≥6 mmol/L, leukocytes > 2 ×109/L, platelet\ncount > 75 ×109/L, bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) and aspartate aminotrans-\nferase (ASAT) < 3 times the upper limit of normal and albumin > 3 g/dL [2,3].\n8. PRRT-Related Toxicity\nAdverse events related to PRRT are frequently mild and include nausea, abdominal pain\nand asthenia [ 27,50]. Increased hair loss is observed in up to 60% of patients treated with\n177Lu-DOTATATE, but this is temporary and seldom leads to baldness [ 88]. Besides these\nmild adverse events, PRRT can induce more severe toxicities which can be dose-limiting and\nadjustments to the treatment schedule might be required [ 89]. When the toxicity has subsided\nwithin 16 weeks after the last dose, guidelines advise to administer half of the original activity\nof177Lu-DOTATATE during the next cycle. PRRT should be discontinued when the toxicity\npersists after 16 weeks or recurs after the half dose [ 3].

The vast\nmajority of patients only have mild and reversible hematological toxicity with a nadir at\n4–6 weeks after administration of PRRT [ 27,36,50]. However, grade 3 or 4 neutropenia,\nthrombocytopenia or leukopenia have been observed in, respectively, 1%, 2% and 1% of\nthe patients treated with177Lu-DOTATATE in the NETTER-1 trial [ 27]. PRRT-induced\nsevere lymphopenia is the most common hematological toxicity [ 27,29], but it has not been\nassociated with increased susceptibility for infections [90]. Thrombocytopenia is the most\ncommon cause of dose reduction in PRRT, whereas bleeding complications are rare [ 27].\nCaution should be taken in patients with widespread bone metastases (Figure 2A), due\nto the risk of persistent cytopenia. In the absence of alternative treatment options, PRRT\nshould preferably be initiated at half the regular activity (3.7 GBq)177Lu-DOTATATE in\nthese patients. Additionally, there is a relevant long-term risk of 2% for the development\nof myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and 1% for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) after\nPRRT [ 27,29,91]. Little is known about the pathophysiology of persistent hematological\ntoxicity, but a role for clonal hematopoiesis has been postulated [ 92]. Known risk factors\nfor severe hematological toxicity include decreased renal function, pre-existent cytopenias,\nextensive tumor mass, age over 70, extensive bone metastases and pre-treatment with\nmyelotoxic chemotherapy [ 91,93,94]. Additionally, women are at higher risk for developing\nsubacute grade ≥2 thrombocytopenia than men, which was independent from other risk\nfactors in a multivariable analysis [89].\n8.2. Nephrotoxicity\nDue to SSTR expression in the kidneys and the renal excretion of radiolabeled SSAs, the\nkidneys receive a high radiation dose during PRRT. Following glomerular filtration, SSAs are re-\nabsorbed in the proximal tubuli of the renal cortex because of active transport mechanisms [ 95].\nBy saturating this re-uptake mechanism through the use of lysine and arginine, re-absorption of\nradiolabeled peptides can be significantly reduced. This results in less radiation-induced nephro-\ntoxicity by a reduction of the absorbed kidney dose up to 40% [ 96,97]. However, nephrotoxicity\nafter PRRT still occurs such as tubulointerstitial scarring, atrophy and thrombotic microan-\ngiopathy [ 98]. In the NETTER-1 study , grade ≥3 renal toxicity was observed in 5% of the\n177Lu-DOTATATE group and in 4% of the control group [ 30]. Bergsma et al. reported an overall\ncreatinine clearance loss of 3.4% 1 year after PRRT. No subacute grade ≥3 renal toxicity was\nseen and 1.5% of the patients showed grade 3 renal toxicity in the long term. However, all these\npatients had a creatinine clearance of <60 mL/min at baseline [ 99]. A reduced kidney function\ncan lead to a delayed renal excretion of177Lu-DOTATATE and this has also been associated with\na higher risk of hematological toxicity [ 95]. Risk factors associated with renal toxicity include\nage > 60 years, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, pre-existing renal disease, cumulative radiation\ndose to the kidneys, previous nephrotoxic chemotherapy , tumor or metastases close to the\nkidney and previous PRRT with90Y-DOTATOC [ 100]. Post-renal obstruction can be observed in\nsome GEP-NET patients, particularly in those with retroperitoneal or pelvic metastases, but this\ncan also be caused by the primary tumor, nephrolithiasis and abdominal or retroperitoneal fi-\nbrosis [ 101].']",2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,165

The classi ﬁcation of NENs\nhas recently been updated by the WHO according to morphology\nand proliferation as well differentiated neuroendocrine tumors\n(NETs) (G1 to G3) and poorly differentiated neuroendocrine\ncarcinomas (NECs) (G3) ( Table 2 )(3).\nNETs may be clinically silent ( ‘non-functioning ’) or may\nsynthesize and secrete a variety of peptides and neuroamines\nwhich lead to the development of characteristic clinical\nsyndromes, including carcinoid syndrome and functional\npancreatic tumors such as insulinoma (hypoglycemia) and\ngastrinoma (gastric hyperacidity). The non-functioning tumors\ntend to present late with widespread metastatic disease,\nparticularly in the liver. NETss tend to be indolent in\ncharacter and patients can still live for relatively prolonged\nperiods with good quality of life even with metastatic disease ( 4).\nThe incidence of NENs is increasing year-on-year. In the\nUSA, the SEER database has documented a 6,4-fold increase in\nincidence between 2007 (1,09 per 100.000) and 2012 (6,98 per\n100.000) ( 5). This increase has included gastroenteropancreatic\n(GEP) NENs with the highest incidence being seen in adults\naged 74-80) ( 6) The age-standardized incidence rate of NENs in\nthe UK between 2013-2015 has been reported as 8.6 per 100,000,\nwith an incidence of 4.6 per 100,000 for gastroenteropancreatic\n(GEP) NENs ( 7).\nGEP-NETs are graded with increasing aggressivity as G1, G2\nor G3, based on Ki-67 labeling index, mitotic count and\nhistological differentiation ( Table 2 )(3). Well differentiated G1\nand G2 GEP-NETs typically show a slower progression and better\nprognosis than G3 GEP-NETs ( 8). A characteristic feature ofGEP-NETs is that a majority express functioning somatostatin\nreceptors (SSTRs) 2 and 5. This renders the tumors amenable to\ntreatment with synthetic somatostatin peptides, which can inhibit\nfunctional secretion and also stabilize tumor growth ( 9). These\nsynthetic peptides, conjugated with a chelator, can be ef ﬁciently\nradiolabeled with photon-, positron- or particle-emitting\nradionuclides. The expression of SSTR2 enables GEP-NETs to\nbe imaged with receptor targeted high resolution PET/CT(DOTATOC/DOTATATE-Ga-68). In addition, tumors can be\ntreated with therapeutic Lu-177 DOTATOC/DOTATATE ( 10).\nPatients with G1 and G2 GEP-NETS often present late, with\nmetastatic disease. Until recently, somatostatin analogues and\nthe molecularly targeted drugs Sunitinib andEverolimus as well\nas chemotherapy in PNETs have provided the mainstays of\ntreatment ( 11). These treatments usually result in disease\nstabilization for a limited period of time. In the RADIANT-3\ntrial, Everolimus achieved a progression free survival (PFS) of 11\nmonths in pancreatic NETS (PNETs) and a similar PFS was\nachieved in midgut and pulmonary NETs in the RADIANT-4\ntrial ( 12,13).\nPRRT has recently emerged as a novel treatment option for\npatients with G1 and G2 GEP-NETs.', 'long-term safety of PRRT in NET. The main organs of concern\nare the bone marrow and the kidney. Transient hematotoxicity,\nparticularly thrombocytopenia, is frequently seen usually around\n4-6 weeks after a treatment cycle but this usually rapidly\nrecovers, allowing a following cycle of treatment. Long-term\nmyelodysplasia or leukaemia appears to occur in a little over 2%\nof patients, although historically, many have been heavily pre-\ntreated.

PRRT has\nbeen shown to be ben ﬁcial in the management of patients with\nsymptoms of carcinoid syndrome ( 30). ESMO Guidelines\nrecommend the use of Lu-177-DOTATATE following\nsomatostatin analogue therapy, for the treatment of patients\nwith carcinoid syndrome, diarrhea and/or ﬂushing.

However, objective tumor re-sponses were rare [ 15,16]. The next generation of analogues\nused in PRRT consisted of [Tyr3]octreotide as a somatostatinanalogue and DOTA as a chelator (instead of DTPA), whichallows stable binding of the β-emitting radionuclide\n90Y . Its\nmaximal tissue penetration is 12 mm and its half-life is2.7 days. [\n90Y-DOTA0,Tyr3]octreotide (90Y-DOTATOC) was\nused in multiple phase I and phase II PRRT trials across sev-\neral countries [ 17–24], with reported objective responses rang-\ning from 4 to 33%. It is mainly due to differences in cycle\ndoses, administered cumulative dose, as well as variabilities\nin patients ’characteristics (such as various tumor types and\npatient performance statuses) that make these studies very dif-\nficult to compare. Different studies report median progression-free survival (PFS) varying from 17 to 29 months and medianoverall survival (OS) from 22 to 37 months [ 21–24].\n177Lu-DOTATATE is currently the most widely used\nradiopeptide for PRRT [ 21]. It has shown similar efficacy\nwhen compared to90Y-DOTATOC, while showing a more\nfavorable toxicity profile, especially when speaking of hema-\ntological and renal toxicity [ 25,26]. In a recent study on bron-\nchial and GEP-NETs, Brabander et al. [ 27] evaluated safety,\nefficacy and toxicity of177Lu-DOTATATE and showed im-\npressive results. The objective response rate (ORR) reached\n39%, stable disease (SD) was reported in 43% of patients, andthe PFS and OS for all NET patients were 29 and 63 months,\nrespectively (Fig. 3).\nWith time, the use of PRRT which initially targeted\nNETs was extended to other types of confirmed SSTR-positive tumors. Tumors such as breast cancer, lymphoma,\nglioma, meningioma, and paraganglioma, as well as non-\niodine-absorbing differentiated thyroid cancer can now be\nconsidered for PRRT when registered therapies have failed[8].\n177Lu Radionuclide and NETTER-1 Trial\nThe Neuroendocrine Tumors Therapy (NETTER-1) trial is thefirst randomized controlled trial that evaluated the efficacy\nFig. 1 aMIP image of68Ga\nDOTATOC PET shows the\nprimary NET in the small bowel\non the right side of the abdomen\n(red arrow) with extensive livermetastases, both demonstratingintense increased radiotracer\nuptake reflecting the high\nexpression of the somatostatinreceptors.

9E advanced RAG,Is PRRT the future for metastatic cancer patients?,english,general,therapy,claude-3-opus-20240229 advanced RAG,"Based on the provided context, PRRT shows promise for the treatment of metastatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), but it is not clear if it will be the future for all metastatic cancer patients. A few key points:

- PRRT has demonstrated high response rates and prolonged progression-free survival in patients with advanced GEP-NETs, with limited serious adverse events compared to other treatments like high-dose octreotide [1].

- PRRT was associated with significant tumor size reduction and rendered some inoperable PanNETs operable, even enabling complete responses in some cases [1]. 

- PRRT is recommended in treatment guidelines for progressive GEP-NETs and PNETs after failure of other therapies like somatostatin analogues, everolimus, sunitinib or chemotherapy [2].

- However, the optimal PRRT treatment regimen and positioning in the treatment algorithm still need to be defined. Ongoing clinical trials are evaluating PRRT in first-line therapy for NETs [2].

In summary, while PRRT is a promising targeted radiotherapy option for metastatic NETs, more data is needed to determine if it will become the future standard treatment for metastatic cancer patients more broadly. Its role is currently focused on certain NET subtypes after progression on other therapies.","['Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2022 ,23, 1447 15 of 22\nstudies examining the feasibility, outcome, and safety of PRRT also demonstrated a PFS\ncomparable to, and in some cases superior to, that of other treatment modalities. Due to\nthe retrospective nature of these studies, the results required conﬁrmation in prospective\ntrials. According to PanNET guidelines, PRRT should even be used as a third-line therapy\nin patients with advanced locoregional disease following the failure of SSAs, everolimus,\nand/or cytotoxic chemotherapy [ 8]. Two cases were presented for third-line therapy, in\nwhich patients with metastatic PanNET (G2 Ki-67 10%) received chemotherapy or PRRT\naccording to the standard of care following SSA failure. After six cycles of STZ/5-FU (over\nnine months), the patient progressed four months later without treatment. The majority of\nparticipants preferred PRRT (38.6%, n = 32) over STZ/5-FU reinduction (26.5%, n = 22) [ 136].\nIn patients with GEP-NET G1 and G2, 177Lu-PRRT was compared to the mTOR inhibitor\neverolimus. Despite the success of 177Lu-DOTATATE PRRT, not all patients showed bene-\nﬁts, and patients typically relapsed 2–3 years after initiating treatment. As a result, various\nexperimental approaches and strategies are being investigated in order to maximize PRRT’s\neffectiveness while minimizing potential side effects [ 8]. The NETTER-1 phase III study\ndemonstrated that, in addition to improving progression-free survival, 177Lu-Dotatate\nsigniﬁcantly improves patient quality of life signiﬁcantly when compared to high-dose\noctreotide [ 137]. In the study where 229 patients randomly received Lu-DOTATATE every\neight weeks for four cycles plus 30 mg octreotide every four weeks or high-dose octreotide\n(60 mg) every four weeks alone showed a signiﬁcant reduction in tumour progression or\ndeath in the Lu-DOTATATE treatment group. According to recent investigations, the time\nto quality of life decline was substantially longer in the 177Lu-DOTATATE therapy group.\nAfter the NETTER-1 phase III trial, the 177Lu-DOTATATE treatment was approved for\nthe somatostatin receptor-positive GEP-NETs [ 138]. To begin, treatment may be continued\nafter four cycles of PRRT, depending on kidney and bone marrow tolerance, for example,\nwith a reduced radioactivity as part of the salvage therapy (Re-PRRT). Retreatment with\n177Lu-DOTATATE-based PRRT showed an optimistic survival beneﬁt with acceptable\nsafety in patients with NETs [ 139]. The administration of PRRT intra-arterially into the\nhepatic artery rather than intravenously may increase the tumour-absorbed dose in liver\nmetastases. However, intra-arterial administration is not mentioned in guidelines and is\nconsidered experimental [ 140]. Patients with hepatic dominant metastases, in particular,\nwould beneﬁt from this approach due to the increased uptake of the radiopharmaceutical\n(the so-called “ﬁrst-pass” effect). In a neoadjuvant setting, the PRRT is becoming increas-\ningly important. PRRT was associated with a signiﬁcant reduction in tumour size and the\ntumour was rendered operable in patients with inoperable PanNETs and distant (metastatic)\ndisease. In such instances, a complete response was possible [ 8]. PRRT was likely to be\nthe best treatment option in patients with advanced well-differentiated NETs in terms\nof the beneﬁt–risk ratio. Numerous nonrandomized studies of PRRT have consistently\ndemonstrated high response rates and prolonged PFS in patients with GEP-NETs. In a more\nrecent randomized phase III trial, PRRT plus the best supportive care provided a longer PFS\nthan high-dose octreotide, and did so with limited serious adverse events (SAEs) in patients\nwith advanced midgut NETs.', 'PRRT was associated with a signiﬁcant reduction in tumour size and the\ntumour was rendered operable in patients with inoperable PanNETs and distant (metastatic)\ndisease.

However, PRRT has not been directly compared to any other\nestablished regimen. PRRT outperformed SSA, everolimus, sunitinib, everolimus + SSA ,\nand everolimus + bevacizumab in terms of PFS. PRRT had the highest probability (96%)\nof being the most effective treatment in terms of improving PFS and posing a low risk of\nSAEs based on cluster ranking [129].\nOnly SSTR agonists have been labelled with beta-emitters thus far. SSTR antagonists\nare expected to have a higher afﬁnity for somatostatin-positive tumour cells, resulting in\nan increase in the radiation dose delivered to the tumour. Another intriguing approach\nis to use alpha emitters such as Bismuth-213 (tissue penetration 45 µm, t1\n245 min) or\nActinium-225 (tissue penetration 45 µm, t1\n210 d) as a targeted alpha particle therapy (TAT).\nTAT treatment has gained popularity in recent years, particularly in the treatment of the\ncastration-resistant prostate cancer-expressing 177Luprostate-speciﬁc membrane antigen.\nThe advantage, it has been hypothesized, is a shallow tissue penetration depth combined', 'long-term safety of PRRT in NET.

The decision to provide PRRNTshould be taken within a multidisciplinary tumour board,\nincluding all the specialists involved in the care of patients\nwith NET. The facility requirements will depend on nationallegislation on the therapeutic use of radioactive agents. If\ninpatient therapy is required by national legislation, the\ntreatment should take place in an approved facility. Thefacility must have appropriate personnel, radiation safety\nequipment, and procedures for waste management and han-\ndling accidental contamination of the site or personnel.\n90Y-DOTATOC or177Lu-DOTATATE should be admin-\nistered by appropriately trained medical staff with support-\ning nursing staff with a medical physics expert available.\nPhysicians responsible for treating patients should have a\ngeneral knowledge of the pathophysiology and natural historyof the respective diseases, should be familiar with alternative\nforms of therapy, and should be able to closely liaise with\nother physicians involved in managing the patients.

Nephrotoxicity may be aggravated by risk factors,such as preexisting hypertension or diabetes mellitus [ 57]. To\ncounteract and reduce the high kidney retention of radiopep-\ntides, positively charged amino acids, such as\nL-lysine and/or\nL-arginine, are coinfused to competitively inhibit the proximal\ntubular reabsorption of the radiopeptide. The coadministration\nof these amino acids leads to a significant reduction in the\nrenal absorbed dose, which ranges from 9 % to 53 % [ 58].\nRenal absorbed dose is further reduced by up to 39 % byextending the infusion time of the amino acid solution over\n10 h, and up to 65 % by extending the protection over 2 days\nfollowing radiopeptide administration, thereby covering therenal elimination phase more efficiently [ 59,60].\nAmino acid protection protocols\nLysine and/or arginine should be diluted appropriately in\nlarge volumes of normal saline in order to hydrate thepatient, unless the patient suffers from cardiac insufficiency\n(e.g. carcinoid heart valve disease), in which case volume\noverload, possibly leading to acute exacerbation of the con-dition, should be avoided.

An appropriate dilution is\n25 g of amino acid in 1 l of normal saline.\nBefore beginning the amino acid infusion, appropriate\nmeasures against nausea and vomiting should be undertaken\nby administering an antiemetic (e.g. 5-HT3 antagonist, such as\ngranisetron) and/or a corticosteroid (e.g.', 'Cancers 2022 ,14, 5792 7 of 17\ncompared to 11.0 months for sunitinib treatment in patients with advanced, SSTR-positive,\nprogressive panNET [ 70]. Currently, the randomized phase III COMPETE trial is comparing\nPRRT with177Lu-edotreotide with everolimus in advanced, progressive GEP-NET patients.\nA subset of GEP-NET patients present with extensive tumor bulk or high proliferative rate\n(Ki-67 index of 10–55%). In these cases, treatment with octreotide LAR or lanreotide has\nquestionable antiproliferative effects [ 71]. Given its ORR of 39%, which increases to 55% in\npanNETs [ 29],177Lu-DOTATATE can be considered as ﬁrst-line therapy if response is clini-\ncally necessitated [ 72]. These response rates compare favorably to targeted therapy [ 73–75]\nand for panNETs appear similar to capecitabine–temozolomide chemotherapy [ 76]. Poorly\ndifferentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs) and well-differentiated grade 3 NETs\nare high-grade NENs that display a more aggressive biological behavior than the more\ncommon grade 1 and 2 NETs [ 77]. PRRT is currently not considered a standard treatment\noption for high-grade NENs [68,78]. The rate of SSTR 2expression in grade 3 NETs ranges\nfrom 67–92% and in NECs from 32–50%, compared to a positive expression rate in grade 1\nand 2 NETs ranging from 67–96% [ 5,79–82]. In a meta-analysis of PRRT comprising four\nstudies, grade 3 NET patients had a median PFS of 19 months and median OS of 44 months\nafter PRRT. The median PFS was 11 and 4 months and the median OS was 22 and 9 months\nfor NEC with a Ki-67 of 21–55% and NEC with a Ki-67 above 55%, respectively [ 83]. Recent\nstudies implicated that PRRT could be considered in grade 3 GEP-NETs and GEP-NEC\nwith a Ki-67 of 21–55%. Importantly, to qualify for PRRT, uptake in all lesions is required\non somatostatin receptor imaging [83].\n7. Eligibility Criteria for PRRT\nThere are several inclusion and exclusion criteria to decide if a patient is eligible for\ntreatment with PRRT. A key criterion for PRRT is the degree of uptake on SSTR imaging\nwhich is scored by the Krenning score based on planar111In-DTPA-octereotide imaging.\nIt was reported that68Ga-DOTA-SSA PET/CT results in higher Krenning scores than\n111In-DTPA-octereotide imaging [ 84]. The uptake of all tumor lesions should minimally\nbe equal to the physiological uptake in the liver (Krenning score grade 2) on111In-DTPA-\noctreotide scintigraphy or higher than the physiological uptake in the liver on68Ga-DOTA-\nSSA PET/CT for a patient to be eligible for PRRT. The latter functional imaging is more\naccurate for detecting SSTR-positive primary tumors and metastases and therefore su-\nperior for assessing the total extent of disease [ 85–87]. PRRT is only applicable for pa-\ntients with a Karnofsky Performance Scale of at least 60 [ 27]. PRRT is contra-indicated\nfor patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding, patients with severe cardiac impairment\n(NYHA III or IV) and those with a life expectancy less than 3 months [ 31]. Since PRRT\ncan induce toxicity, the following pre-treatment laboratory values are required: creatinine\nclearance > 40 mL/min, hemoglobin levels ≥6 mmol/L, leukocytes > 2 ×109/L, platelet\ncount > 75 ×109/L, bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) and aspartate aminotrans-\nferase (ASAT) < 3 times the upper limit of normal and albumin > 3 g/dL [2,3].\n8.']",4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1.0,1.0,1.0,129

The antitumoral\neffect of PRRT is triggered by radiation-induced DNA damage.

Mechanism of Action  \nPRRT with \n177Lu-DOTATATE uses an intravenously administered beta radiation -\nemitting radiopharmaceutical targeting SSTR on tumor cells.

Healthy non- diseased organs can also express \nSSTR subtypes, as can be seen in the healthy liver, spleen, pituitary, salivary glands, thy-\nroid, adrenals, kidney, prostate, panc reas, intestine and blood vessels [7 –9]. The anti-\ntumoral effect of PRRT is triggered by radiation -induced DNA damage.

Mechanism of action of PRRT with 177Lu-DOTATATE. Intravenous administration of 177Lu-\nDOTATATE leads to tumor cell binding via SSTR 2.

The Choice for 177Lu-DOTATATE \nClinical development of PRRT commenced with SSAs labeled with indium -111, yt-\ntrium -90 and lutetium -177 [12].', 'Cancers 2022 ,14, 5792 6 of 17\nwhich an antiemetic, typically ondansetron or granisetron, should be given prophylactically\nbefore the start of the infusion.177Lu-DOTATATE allows for post-therapy scintigraphy\nwith planar imaging or SPECT/CT. At patient discharge, the radiation exposure should be\nmeasured and patients should receive tailored advice on the duration of radiation safety\nprecautions at home, to avoid a high radiation exposure to other people, particularly children\nand pregnant women. Patients with NET-associated hormonal syndromes who have an\nindication for continuation of SSA use should adjust the moment of the injections to the\nPRRT cycles. Long-acting SSA should not be given within 4–6 weeks before a cycle of PRRT\nbecause of interference with the radiolabeled SSA. Although there is conflicting evidence\nfrom two limited single center studies whether continuation of SSA treatment is beneficial in\nnon-functioning NETs [ 63,64], this practice is often adopted. If the patient suffers from severe\nhormonal symptoms, short-acting SSA can be used to bridge this period up till 24 h before\nPRRT. Radiopharmaceuticals such as177Lu-DOTATATE need to be administered at specialized\nfacilities by medical personnel trained in radiation safety. These facilities should adhere to\nnational and international regulations on the use of radiopharmaceuticals and be licensed by\nthe regulatory authorities. Depending on local protocol and exposure regulations, PRRT with\n177Lu-DOTATATE can be given in an in-patient as well as an out-patient setting. In between\ncycles, patients should be reviewed for adverse effects, including full blood count and renal\nand liver function. Response evaluation by cross-sectional imaging is usually performed 2–3\nand 6 months after the last cycle of PRRT. Long-term follow-up is determined on an individual\nbasis taking into account the tumor biology and therapeutic response [ 65]. Pseudo-progression\nis a phenomenon that should be considered in the response evaluation when an increase in\ntumor size is seen during or short after treatment with PRRT. Pseudo-progression is probably\nbased on localized, temporarily edema caused by inflammation as a response to PRRT and\ndoes not show the actual tumor response to the therapy [ 58]. When pseudo-progression is\nsuspected, functional imaging (for example, PET/CT) can help differentiate between true\nprogression and pseudo-progression [31].\n5. Salvage PRRT\nIn NET patients who showed tumor response at least 18 months after the first cycle of\n177Lu-DOTATATE, re-treatment with PRRT (R-PRRT) with two additional cycles of 7.4 GBq\neach after renewed PD has shown antitumoral effects. In a meta-analysis on the effect of\nR-PRRT, the pooled median PFS was 14 months with a pooled median OS of 27 months.\nSimilarly, the pooled ORR was 17% with a disease control rate of 77%. Response rates,\nPFS and OS were lower than for initial PRRT [ 66], nonetheless R-PRRT remains a potential\noption for GEP-NET patients when other systemic treatment options are limited. The limited\nefficacy of R-PRRT as compared to initial PRRT might be explained by the administration\nof lower cumulative activity (i.e., generally half of the initial PRRT dosage) [ 51], the increase\nin tumor bulk at baseline before R-PRRT and potential changes in the tumor biology, such\nas a longitudinal increase in Ki-67. In the largest study to date by van der Zwan et al., no\ndifference in toxicity after R-PRRT as compared with initial PRRT was observed, particularly\nno increased occurrence of nephrotoxicity or significant hematological disease [ 67]. In cases\nwhere R-PRRT has provided additional benefit on tumor response and prolonged PFS, further\nre-treatment at the time of progression can be considered [67].\n6.

Introduction\nPeptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) with radiolabeled somatostatin analogs\n(SSAs) has become an established second- or third-line treatment option for patients with\nprogressive well-differentiated (grade 1–2) gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) neuroendocrine\ntumors (NETs). Due to the increasing incidence and prevalence of GEP-NETs over recent\ndecades [ 1] and the development of NET-speciﬁc treatments and treatment protocols, there\nis a growing utilization of such systemic treatment for this advanced patient group. PRRT\nwith [177Lu]Lu-[DOTA0,Tyr3]octreotate (177Lu-DOTATATE) is the ﬁrst registered theranos-\ntic application in the ﬁeld of NETs [ 2,3]. With this therapy, radiolabeled SSAs target the\nsomatostatin receptor (SSTR) subtype 2 that is over-expressed on the cancer cell surface [ 4].\nTreatment of NET patients with PRRT requires dedicated clinical expertise due to the\nbiological characteristics of PRRT (for example, binding to SSTR, DNA damage induction\nCancers 2022 ,14, 5792. https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers14235792 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/cancers', 'however, still used by some in the USA mainly due to the lack\nof availability of β-emitting radiotracers. High-energy βemit-\nters, such as90Y with a longer βrange in soft tissue, were\nconsidered more promising for the treatment of bulky tumour.\nA novel analogue, Tyr3-octreotide, with a similar affinity\nprofile for sstrs, was developed. Linked to a macrocyclicchelator (DOTA), it allows simple and stable radiolabelling\nof\n111In and90Y to [DOTA0,Tyr3]-octreotide (90Y-DOTA-\nTOC) [ 44]. PRRNT using90Y-DOTATOC was first used in\n1996 in a patient in Basel, Switzerland. The excellent subjec-\ntive and objective response following several cycles of90Y-\nDOTATOC led to high expectations as to the therapeuticpotential of PRRNT in patients with NET. Since then other\ncentres worldwide have conducted clinical trials with\n90Y-\nDOTATOC [ 45]. Since the year 2000, octreotate (Tyr3,Thr8-\noctreotide), a newer analogue with improved affinity for sstr2,\nhas been synthesized. The chelated analogue [DOTA0,Tyr3]-\noctreotate (DOTATATE) can be labelled with the β-a n d γ-\nemitting isotope177Lu and has been used in clinical studies.\nIndications and contraindications\nIndications\nPRRNT is indicated for the treatment of patients with\npositive expression of sstr2, or metastatic or inoperable\nNET [ 46–50]. Candidate patients for PRRNT using\nradiolabelled somatostatin analogues are mainly those\nwith sstr2-expressing NET of the gastroenteropancreatic\nand bronchial tracts, but may also include patients withphaeochromocytoma, paraganglioma, neuroblastoma [ 51]\nor medullary thyroid carcinoma [ 52–56].

Nephrotoxicity may be aggravated by risk factors,such as preexisting hypertension or diabetes mellitus [ 57]. To\ncounteract and reduce the high kidney retention of radiopep-\ntides, positively charged amino acids, such as\nL-lysine and/or\nL-arginine, are coinfused to competitively inhibit the proximal\ntubular reabsorption of the radiopeptide. The coadministration\nof these amino acids leads to a significant reduction in the\nrenal absorbed dose, which ranges from 9 % to 53 % [ 58].\nRenal absorbed dose is further reduced by up to 39 % byextending the infusion time of the amino acid solution over\n10 h, and up to 65 % by extending the protection over 2 days\nfollowing radiopeptide administration, thereby covering therenal elimination phase more efficiently [ 59,60].\nAmino acid protection protocols\nLysine and/or arginine should be diluted appropriately in\nlarge volumes of normal saline in order to hydrate thepatient, unless the patient suffers from cardiac insufficiency\n(e.g. carcinoid heart valve disease), in which case volume\noverload, possibly leading to acute exacerbation of the con-dition, should be avoided. Hyperosmotic solutions in partic-\nular should be avoided since they can induce dangerous\nelectrolyte imbalances that might lead to severe metabolicacidosis and cardiac arrhythmias. An appropriate dilution is\n25 g of amino acid in 1 l of normal saline.\nBefore beginning the amino acid infusion, appropriate\nmeasures against nausea and vomiting should be undertaken\nby administering an antiemetic (e.g. 5-HT3 antagonist, such as\ngranisetron) and/or a corticosteroid (e.g.', 'ensure an accurate diagnosis or a successful outcome. All that\nshould be expected is that the practitioner will follow a reason-\nable course of action based on current knowledge, available re-\nsources, and the needs of the patient to deliver effective and safe\nmedical care. The sole purpose of these procedure standards is to\nassist practitioners in ac hieving this objective.\nBACKGROUND\nNETs are a heterogeneous group of malignancies that frequently\noverexpress somatostatin receptors (SSTRs) ( 1). NETs can be im-\naged using somatostatin analogs (SSAs) labeled with68Ga (68Ga-\nDOTATATE and68Ga-DOTATOC) ( 2).b-emitting radionuclides\nsuch as177Lu can be used for PRRT ( 3). The NETTER-1 trial\ndemonstrated prolonged progression-free survival in midgut NET\npatients treated with 4 cycles of177Lu-DOTATATE, which subse-\nquently led to the approval of this therapy ( 4).\nTREATMENT OVERVIEW\n177Lu-DOTATATE is administered at an activity of 7.4 GBq\n(200 mCi) every 8 61 wk for 4 cycles. Combined with prophy-\nlactic amino acid infusions and antiemetics, each treatment visit\ncan last approximately 5–8 h ( Fig. 1). Before starting PRRT treat-\nments, each treatment site must ensure that177Lu is included in their\ninstitutional radioactive materials license. A detailed review of pro-\ncedures surrounding177Lu-DOTATATE therapy is provided below.\nPATIENT SCREENING\nPatients should be evaluated by a multidisciplinary NET team,\nincluding a cancer specialist with expertise in the medical man-\nagement of NETs as well as a nuclear medicine physician or\nappropriate authorized user to decide on the appropriateness and\ntiming of PRRT in individual patients. Potential candidates should\nundergo an SSTR PET scan or SSTR scintigraphy (111In-pentetreotide)\nto demonstrate adequate SSTR expression ( 2). Traditionally, SSTR\nexpression on111In-pentetreotide greater than background hepatic\nuptake has been considered an eligibility requirement for PRRT\n(5). Necessary levels of SSTR expression on68Ga-based SSTR\nPET have not been clearly deﬁned, but lesion uptake should ex-\nceed background hepatic uptake. Laboratory values should be\nchecked shortly before the treatment is ordered (typically 2 wk\nbefore each cycle). These should include blood urea nitrogen,\ncreatinine, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotrans-\nferase, alanine aminotransferase, total bilirubin, white blood cell\nwith differential, hemoglobin, and platelet counts. The threshold\nvalues provided in Table 1 should be taken as general eligibility\nguidelines for therapy.SOMATOSTATIN ANALOG THERAPY\nSSA therapy is used frequently to treat NET patients, and SSAs\nare typically administered in depot formulations every 4 wk. It is\nrecommended that PRRT treatments be scheduled at least 4 wk\nafter the last long-acting SSA therapy to prevent interference with\nSSTR binding. For symptomatic patients, short-acting SSAs being\nused as a bridge should be stopped at least 24 h before treatment.\nSubsequent SSA doses can be administered as soon as several hours\nafter the completion of the radiopharmaceutical therapy. During and\nafter completion of PRRT, it is generally agreed that syndromic\npatients should remain on SSA therapy. It is unclear whether patients\nwith nonfunctional tumors should remain on SSA treatment regard-\nless of whether or not they had progressed on SSA therapy before\ninitiation of PRRT. In the NETTER-1 study, all patients remained\non long-acting release octreotide despite prior progression on this\ndrug, and the177Lu-DOTATATE package insert suggests that patients\nshould remain on SSAs for up to 18 mo after treatment ( 6). How-\never, there are no clear data to support or refute this recommendation.\nTREATMENT LOCATION\nSites have the option to provide PRRT in an inpatient or out-\npatient setting, within the oncology infusion clinic or nuclear med-\nicine department, or a combination of both locations. Most sites in\nthe United States treat in the outpatient setting.', 'however, still used by some in the USA mainly due to the lack\nof availability of β-emitting radiotracers. High-energy βemit-\nters, such as90Y with a longer βrange in soft tissue, were\nconsidered more promising for the treatment of bulky tumour.\nA novel analogue, Tyr3-octreotide, with a similar affinity\nprofile for sstrs, was developed. Linked to a macrocyclicchelator (DOTA), it allows simple and stable radiolabelling\nof\n111In and90Y to [DOTA0,Tyr3]-octreotide (90Y-DOTA-\nTOC) [ 44]. PRRNT using90Y-DOTATOC was first used in\n1996 in a patient in Basel, Switzerland. The excellent subjec-\ntive and objective response following several cycles of90Y-\nDOTATOC led to high expectations as to the therapeuticpotential of PRRNT in patients with NET. Since then other\ncentres worldwide have conducted clinical trials with\n90Y-\nDOTATOC [ 45]. Since the year 2000, octreotate (Tyr3,Thr8-\noctreotide), a newer analogue with improved affinity for sstr2,\nhas been synthesized. The chelated analogue [DOTA0,Tyr3]-\noctreotate (DOTATATE) can be labelled with the β-a n d γ-\nemitting isotope177Lu and has been used in clinical studies.\nIndications and contraindications\nIndications\nPRRNT is indicated for the treatment of patients with\npositive expression of sstr2, or metastatic or inoperable\nNET [ 46–50]. Candidate patients for PRRNT using\nradiolabelled somatostatin analogues are mainly those\nwith sstr2-expressing NET of the gastroenteropancreatic\nand bronchial tracts, but may also include patients withphaeochromocytoma, paraganglioma, neuroblastoma [ 51]\nor medullary thyroid carcinoma [ 52–56]. The ideal can-\ndidates for PRRNT are those w ith well-differentiated\nand moderately differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas\ndefined as NET grade 1 or 2 according to the recent\nWHO 2010 classification [ 4].\nContraindications\nAbsolute\n&Pregnancy.\n&Severe acute concomitant illnesses.\n&Severe unmanageable psychiatric disorder.\nRelative\n&Breast feeding (if not discontinued).\n&Severely compromised renal function: for PRRNT with\na\n90Y-labelled peptide age-adjusted normal renal func-\ntion is essential. Patients with compromised renal func-\ntion may still be considered for177Lu-labelled peptidetreatment. For177Lu-labelled peptide a mild to moderate\ngrade of renal impairment can be tolerated (e.g. creati-\nnine ≤1.7 mg/dl). Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and\ntubular extraction rate (TER) should be at least 60 % of\nmean age-adjusted normal values.\n&Severely compromised bone marrow: noncompromised\nhaematological reserve should be present before\nPRRNT. Suggested reference values are:\nWBC <3,000/ μl, with absolute neutrophil count <1,000/ μl\nPLT <75,000/ μl for177Lu-DOTATATE, <90,000/ μl for\n90Y-DOTATOC,\nRBC <3,000,000/ μl.\nSpecial warnings\nRenal function\nThe kidney is the dose-limiting organ at the activities\nnormally used for PRRNT. Side effects involving the\nkidney and the bone marrow are mild if adequate renalprotection and fractionation are used. Renal function\nshould be assessed by means of laboratory tests (creat-\ninine and BUN), or calculation of creatinine clearance(e.g. Cockroft-Gault formula ). Additional studies, e.g.\nmeasurement of GFR with 24-h urine collection or\nnuclear medicine methods (e.g.\n99mTc-MAG3 with\nTER determination,99mTc-DTPA GFR or effective renal\nplasma flow using hippuran), should be performed in\npatients with risk factors for renal toxicity or withcompromised renal function, and in all children.']",2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0,1.0,1.0,1.0,186

Akute Nebenwirkungen (meist mild und selbstlimitierend):
- Übelkeit und Erbrechen, verursacht durch die gleichzeitige Infusion von Aminosäuren zum Nierenschutz [3]

Subakute Nebenwirkungen (treten innerhalb von 4-6 Wochen nach Therapie auf):  
- Knochenmarksuppression, meist mild und reversibel. Schwere Toxizität (WHO Grad 3-4) tritt bei weniger als 15% der Patienten auf [3]
- Milder Haarausfall, beobachtet bei 177Lu-Octreotate [3]
- In seltenen Fällen eine Verschlimmerung eines klinischen Syndroms [3]

Langfristige Nebenwirkungen:
- Nierenversagen [1,2]
- Leukämie oder myelodysplastische Syndrome, mit einer geschätzten Inzidenz von bis zu 2% [2]","['PRRT is only applicable for pa-\ntients with a Karnofsky Performance Scale of at least 60 [ 27]. PRRT is contra-indicated\nfor patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding, patients with severe cardiac impairment\n(NYHA III or IV) and those with a life expectancy less than 3 months [ 31]. Since PRRT\ncan induce toxicity, the following pre-treatment laboratory values are required: creatinine\nclearance > 40 mL/min, hemoglobin levels ≥6 mmol/L, leukocytes > 2 ×109/L, platelet\ncount > 75 ×109/L, bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) and aspartate aminotrans-\nferase (ASAT) < 3 times the upper limit of normal and albumin > 3 g/dL [2,3].\n8. PRRT-Related Toxicity\nAdverse events related to PRRT are frequently mild and include nausea, abdominal pain\nand asthenia [ 27,50]. Increased hair loss is observed in up to 60% of patients treated with\n177Lu-DOTATATE, but this is temporary and seldom leads to baldness [ 88]. Besides these\nmild adverse events, PRRT can induce more severe toxicities which can be dose-limiting and\nadjustments to the treatment schedule might be required [ 89]. When the toxicity has subsided\nwithin 16 weeks after the last dose, guidelines advise to administer half of the original activity\nof177Lu-DOTATATE during the next cycle. PRRT should be discontinued when the toxicity\npersists after 16 weeks or recurs after the half dose [ 3]. In the NETTER-1 trial, 7% of the\npatients received a reduced dose because of dose-limiting toxicities [ 27]. The kidneys and the\nbone marrow are the critical organs for dose-limiting toxicities.', 'J. Clin. Med. 2021 ,10, 1267 11 of 15\n4.5.1. Subacute Effects\nPRRT is overall well tolerated with most patients experiencing only moderate toxicity.\nIn the study NETTER-1, validating the PRRT in midgut NETs, 5% of the patients discon-\ntinued treatment due to toxicity related to PRRT. Acute side effects are mainly nausea,\nvomiting, fatigue and abdominal pain. These adverse events are mainly caused by the\nsimultaneous infusion of aminoacids. Particular vigilance must be exercised with regard\nto the risk of carcinoid crisis. This event was reported in a very small minority (1%) of\npatients who received an PRRT treatment. This crisis usually appears within 48 h of the ﬁrst\ninfusion and is related to the massive release of active amines [ 34]. A myelosuppressure\nhas been described and is caused by the irradiation of the bone marrow. Bone marrow\nis particularly radiosensitive, and this toxicity does not appear to be associated to the\nexpression of SSTRs in myeloid cells. Myelosuppression generally develops four at six\nweeks after the infusion, is usually grade 1/2 and is reversible. Hematotoxic effects grade\n3 and 4 have been described in 13% and 10% of the patients receiving90Y-DOTATOC\nand177Lu-DOTATATE, respectively [ 35]. Lymphopenia is the more often reported severe\ncytopenia. Some studies have also reported that PRRT could be safely used in the case\nof diffuse metastatic bone marrow involvement, without irreversible myelosuppression,\nalthough a higher incidence of subacute transient hematologic toxicity was observed [36]\nOther toxicities have been reported, including a risk of hepatotoxicity in the patients\nwith major liver involvement. Thus, as indicated above, it is desirable to consider PRRT\nearly in the management process of the disease.\n4.5.2. Long-Term Effects\nLong-term side effects of PRRT can include renal failure and leukemic or myelodys-\nplastic syndromes.\nThe radiolabels are reabsorbed in the proximal tubules, may accumulate in the proxi-\nmal tubules in the renal interstitium and cause kidney damage. Because of its higher energy\nand longer penetration range,90Y irradiates the renal interstitium glomeruli more exten-\nsively than177Lu. In a large institutional series of 1109 patients treated with90Y-DOTATOC,\n103 patients (9%) were treated with90Y-DOTATOC with severe renal toxicity [ 7]. Nowa-\ndays, the concomitant administration positively charged aminoacids results in a reduction\nof up to 40% of the renal absorption. Despite renal protection, the median decrease of the\ncreatinine clearance is estimated to 4% per year in patients treated with177Lu-DOTATATE.\nThe risk factors for nephrotoxicity cited are diabetes and poorly controlled hypertension.\nRisk of severe nephrotoxicity (grade 3/4) was observed in only 1.5% of patients [ 37]. In\noverall, end-stage renal disease as a consequence of PRRT is extremely rare.\nCases of leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes have been reported as late-onset\nPRRT toxicity, with an estimated incidence of up to 2% [ 37,38]. Age over 70 years, cytopenia\nbefore treatment, the presence of bones metastasis, the high number of previous treatments,\nthe prior use of an alkylating agent and the radiotherapy increases the risk of secondary\nmyelodysplastic syndrome. Brieau et al. reported in a retrospective monocentric study\nconducted in a population of patients treated with PRRT and pre-treatment alkylating\nchemotherapy an increased risk late hematologic toxicity (20%; four patients out of 20) [ 39].\nThe main alkylating agent used in the NET treatment is temozolomide. The development\nof myelodysplastic syndrome or leukemia has been reported between 30 and 70 months\nafter treatment with PRRT [ 39].', 'Salvage Treatment\nAlthough tumor response rates after initial treatment with\nPRRT are encouraging, CR is rare and eventually tumor pro-\ngression occurs in the majority of patients. Retreatment with\nextra cycles of PRRT as salvage therapy may be consideredwhen better options are not available. One study showed that\nsalvage therapy with two additional cycles of\n177Lu-octreotate\ndoes not lead to serious hematologic or nephrotoxic side ef-\nfects, but the tumor response rate was less compared with\ninitial treatment [ 50].\nAnother report showed that long PFS after the initial treat-\nment with PRRT predicts a prolonged PFS after salvage ther-apy [ 51], and argued that PRRT with\n177Lu-octreotate in the\nretreatment setting is a safe and effective option in patients\nwith metastatic GEP-NETs. For these reasons, retreatment\nseems a good option for patients who responded well after\nthe initial cycles of PRRT [ 52]. This novel and important\nconcept of salvage therapy of NET needs to be tested in large,\nprospective, and multi-center trials to contribute to evidence-\nbased findings.\nTreatment Side Effects\nPRRT is generally well-tolerated. Side effects can be divided to\nacute, subacute, and long-term side effects, as summarized inTable 4. Acute side effects are usually mild and self-limiting.\nNausea or vomiting are related to the concomitant admin-\nistration of kidney-protective amino acids. Subacute side\neffects are related to the radiopeptide itself, such as bonemarrow suppression, mild hair loss (observed with\n177Lu-\noctreotate), or, more rarely, an exacerbation of a clinicalsyndrome. The most common subacute side effect ofPRRT, occurring within 4 to 6 weeks after therapy, is bone\nmarrow suppression. Usually, the hematologic toxicity is\nmild and reversible. More serious WHO grade 3 or 4 tox-icity may occur, but this has been seen in less than 15% of\npatients [ 53].\nLong-term side effects of PRRT may include renal failure\nas well as leukemia/myelody splastic syndromes (MDS).\nBecause radiopeptides are usually reabsorbed in the proximal\ntubules, they can accumulate in the renal interstitium and in-duce inflammation and fibrosis with eventual kidney damage.\nCo-administration of positively charged amino acids results ina reduction of renal radioactive uptake, up to 40% as reportedin some studies [ 16,54]. If patients have long-standing or\npoorly controlled comorbidities such as diabetes and hyper-\ntension that affect kidney function, it is expected that there\nwould be a larger and more persistent decline in creatinine\nclearance [ 55].\nAdministration of Treatment\nFor purposes of kidney protection, positively charged amino\nacids, such as L-lysine and/or L-arginine, are co-infused to\ncompetitively inhibit the proximal tubular reabsorption ofthe radiopeptide [ 56]. This reduces the renal-absorbed dose.\nDilution of the amino acids with saline allows proper hydra-tion for the patient, an appropriate ratio to use is 25 g of aminoacid in 1 L of normal saline. Obviously, patients ’comorbidi-\nties should be taken into account (e.g., avoid volume overloadin patients with cardiac insufficiency and take care in avoidingelectrolyte imbalances with hyperosmotic solutions).\nAntiemetics can be administered before the infusion to avoidpotential nausea or vomiting. Amino acid infusion should bestarted 30 –60 min before administration of the radiopeptide\nand should be maintained over 4 h. Several amino acid pro-tective schemes have been proposed in the joint IAEA,EANM, and SNMMI practical guidelines on PRRT treatment\nof NETs [ 56].\nCurrent administration schedules comprise the most ap-\npropriate number of cycles (generally four or five) and thebest delivery frequency (8 weeks apart). This pattern allows\nthe patient to recover from the mild side effects of the ther-apy and increases its effectiveness in terms of the radiobi-\nological activity [ 57]. Radioisotope infusion should be\naround 30 min as recommended in the literature.']",3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1.0,0.0,0.5,98

The development\nof myelodysplastic syndrome or leukemia has been reported between 30 and 70 months\nafter treatment with PRRT [ 39].', 'during the first courses of therapy following the injection of\n177Lu-DOTATATE.\nSide effects\nAcute\nSide effects of PRRNT are usually mild, if necessary precau-\ntions are taken. Side effects may be acute, related to the\nadministration of amino acids or to the radiopeptide itself, or\nchronic. The coinfusion of amino acids enlarges the safetymargin for treating with higher activities enabling higher\ntumour radiation doses to be attained safely. Side effects such\nas nausea, headache and rarely vomiting due to metabolicacidosis induced by the amino acid coadministration do occur\nin the majority of patients [ 59,88]. Particular attention and\ncare should be given to avoiding possible electrolyte imbal-ance (hyperkalaemia, hypernatraemia), and the subsequent\nmetabolic acidosis, that might lead to mild nausea and vomit-\ning. The latter side effects should be managed by hydrating thepatient with normal saline and possibly by repeating cortico-\nsteroid or antiemetic administrations.\nPRRNT may exacerbate the syndromes related to the re-\nspective functional tumours, due to the sudden massive re-\nlease of the hormones and receptor stimulation. The clinical\nmanifestation is dependent on the specific hormone involved.The following measures are therefore recommended. Vital\nsigns (at least blood pressure and pulse) should be monitored\nbefore and after radiopeptide infusion, especially in symptom-atic patients. Therapeutic interventions should be undertaken\nto treat the for functional syndrome effects or exacerbation\n(e.g. carcinoid syndrome/hypotension, hypoglycaemia, hyper-gastrinaemia, hypertension, hypotension, WDHA syndrome,\nelectrolyte imbalance) [ 89]. In patients without or with minor\nmetastatic liver involvement, no significant hepatic toxicity\nhas been reported. However, in patients with massive liver\nmetastases and impaired liver function, liver toxicity mayoccur, and this should be considered, along with preexisting\nconditions affecting the liver, when choosing the appropriate\nradioisotope and dosing.

After treatment, patients should avoid\npregnancy for at least 6 months. Due to a temporary impair-ment of fertility, related to a transient damage to Sertoli cells,\nmale patients should consider sperm banking before therapy.\nDelayed side effects\nRenal toxicityThe kidneys are the dose-limiting organs at the activities\nnormally reached with PRRNT. Proper kidney protection, asdiscussed, is currently mandatory. However, despite kidney\nprotection, loss of kidney function can occur after PRRNT,\nwith a creatinine clearance loss of about 3.8 % per year for\n177Lu-DOTATATE and 7.3 % per year for90Y-DOTATOC\n[90]. In a series of 1,109 patients treated with90Y-DOTATOC,\nthe incidence of grade 4 and 5 kidney toxicity was found to be9.2 % [ 50]. Delayed renal toxicity following\n90Y-DOTATOC\ntreatment was observed more frequently in patients with pre-\ndisposing risk factors including longstanding and poorly con-trolled hypertension and diabetes mellitus [ 56].\nBone marrow toxicitySevere (grade 3 and 4), mostly reversible, acute bone mar-\nrow toxicity is observed in less than 10 –13 % of treatment\ncycles with\n90Y-DOTATOC, and in 2 –3 % of cycles with\n177Lu-DOTATATE. Nevertheless, sporadic cases of myelo-\ndysplastic syndrome or overt acute myelogenous leukaemiahave been reported [ 45,49,50].\nEndocrine systemsDespite the presence of sstr in normal pituitary, thyroid and\nadrenal glands and Langerhans cells, no significant alterationin endocrine hormone function have been reported [ 91].\nResults\nPRRNT with the somatostatin analogues\n90Y-DOTATOC\nand177Lu-DOTATATE has been explored in NET for more\nthan a decade.', 'PRRT is only applicable for pa-\ntients with a Karnofsky Performance Scale of at least 60 [ 27].

Symptom Control\nPRRT is not only effective in reducing tumor growth, but it can also lead to symp-\ntomatic improvement in NET patients, including associated hormonal syndromes [37]. In\nthe NETTER-1 trial, PRRT with177Lu-DOTATATE provided a signiﬁcant beneﬁt in quality\nof life (QoL) compared to octreotide LAR. Time to deterioration (TTD) was signiﬁcantly\nlonger in the177Lu-DOTATATE group, with positive outcomes in the domains of global\nhealth, physical functioning, diarrhea, pain, body image, disease-related worries and\nfatigue [ 38]. In a prospective series of 265 GEP- and bronchial NET patients, QoL, perfor-\nmance status and symptoms (particularly insomnia, appetite loss and diarrhea) improved\nsigniﬁcantly after PRRT [ 39]. Importantly, QoL in asymptomatic NET patients did not\ndecline during therapy. In a single center study of 144 patients, a symptomatic response to\nPRRT with regard to diarrhea, abdominal pain, ﬂushing and fatigue was observed in 70%,\n63%, 64% and 53%, respectively [ 33]. Results are summarized in Table 1. In patients with a\nfunctioning NET, PRRT has shown to be an effective treatment regarding symptom control\nand circulating hormone levels [ 40,41]. Carcinoid syndrome (CS) is the most prevalent\nhormonal NET syndrome and is caused by excretion of hormones and amines such as\nserotonin, histamine, catecholamines, prostaglandins and tachykinins. In a study involving\n22 patients with refractory CS who received PRRT for symptomatic control, ﬂushing and\nbowel movement frequency improved signiﬁcantly [ 42]. Two-thirds of the patients who\nhad at least two episodes of ﬂushing per day had a minimal decrease of 50% of these\nepisodes. Of patients with bowel movement frequency of at least four times a day, 47%\nexperienced > 30% decrease, while 29% experienced > 50% decrease [ 37]. In a systematic\nreview, symptomatic improvement after PRRT was observed in 74% of patients with diar-\nrhea and in 6% of patients with ﬂushing [ 43]. Together, these results have positioned PRRT\nwith177Lu-DOTATATE as a viable option for refractory CS [ 44]. In addition, case reports\nhave shown improvement of symptoms and echocardiographic parameters of carcinoid\nheart disease after PRRT, which is a severe symptom of CS [ 45]. Similar positive effects of\nPRRT on hormonal levels and symptoms have been observed in patients with functioning\npanNET syndromes, such as insulinoma, gastrinoma, glucagonoma and VIPoma [40].\nTable 1.

Due to\nthe retrospective nature of these studies, the results required conﬁrmation in prospective\ntrials. According to PanNET guidelines, PRRT should even be used as a third-line therapy\nin patients with advanced locoregional disease following the failure of SSAs, everolimus,\nand/or cytotoxic chemotherapy [ 8]. Two cases were presented for third-line therapy, in\nwhich patients with metastatic PanNET (G2 Ki-67 10%) received chemotherapy or PRRT\naccording to the standard of care following SSA failure. After six cycles of STZ/5-FU (over\nnine months), the patient progressed four months later without treatment. The majority of\nparticipants preferred PRRT (38.6%, n = 32) over STZ/5-FU reinduction (26.5%, n = 22) [ 136].\nIn patients with GEP-NET G1 and G2, 177Lu-PRRT was compared to the mTOR inhibitor\neverolimus. Despite the success of 177Lu-DOTATATE PRRT, not all patients showed bene-\nﬁts, and patients typically relapsed 2–3 years after initiating treatment. As a result, various\nexperimental approaches and strategies are being investigated in order to maximize PRRT’s\neffectiveness while minimizing potential side effects [ 8]. The NETTER-1 phase III study\ndemonstrated that, in addition to improving progression-free survival, 177Lu-Dotatate\nsigniﬁcantly improves patient quality of life signiﬁcantly when compared to high-dose\noctreotide [ 137]. In the study where 229 patients randomly received Lu-DOTATATE every\neight weeks for four cycles plus 30 mg octreotide every four weeks or high-dose octreotide\n(60 mg) every four weeks alone showed a signiﬁcant reduction in tumour progression or\ndeath in the Lu-DOTATATE treatment group. According to recent investigations, the time\nto quality of life decline was substantially longer in the 177Lu-DOTATATE therapy group.\nAfter the NETTER-1 phase III trial, the 177Lu-DOTATATE treatment was approved for\nthe somatostatin receptor-positive GEP-NETs [ 138]. To begin, treatment may be continued\nafter four cycles of PRRT, depending on kidney and bone marrow tolerance, for example,\nwith a reduced radioactivity as part of the salvage therapy (Re-PRRT). Retreatment with\n177Lu-DOTATATE-based PRRT showed an optimistic survival beneﬁt with acceptable\nsafety in patients with NETs [ 139]. The administration of PRRT intra-arterially into the\nhepatic artery rather than intravenously may increase the tumour-absorbed dose in liver\nmetastases. However, intra-arterial administration is not mentioned in guidelines and is\nconsidered experimental [ 140]. Patients with hepatic dominant metastases, in particular,\nwould beneﬁt from this approach due to the increased uptake of the radiopharmaceutical\n(the so-called “ﬁrst-pass” effect). In a neoadjuvant setting, the PRRT is becoming increas-\ningly important. PRRT was associated with a signiﬁcant reduction in tumour size and the\ntumour was rendered operable in patients with inoperable PanNETs and distant (metastatic)\ndisease. In such instances, a complete response was possible [ 8]. PRRT was likely to be\nthe best treatment option in patients with advanced well-differentiated NETs in terms\nof the beneﬁt–risk ratio. Numerous nonrandomized studies of PRRT have consistently\ndemonstrated high response rates and prolonged PFS in patients with GEP-NETs. In a more\nrecent randomized phase III trial, PRRT plus the best supportive care provided a longer PFS\nthan high-dose octreotide, and did so with limited serious adverse events (SAEs) in patients\nwith advanced midgut NETs.', 'prolonged for 22,7 months in the ¹ ⁷⁷Lu-DOTATATE group.\nThis included improvement in daily activities, role functioning\n(participation in employment and leisure). Furthermore,\npatients also demonstrated improvements in diarrhea (48%),\nfatigue (50%), treatment scale and body image (63%) endocrine\nscale (61%) and GI scale (60%) ( 16). Detailed analysis of the\ndiaries of the patients indicated signi ﬁcant decrease in the mean\nnumber of symptomatic days with diarrhea, ﬂushing and\nabdominal pain which are the major symptoms of the patients\nwith NETs ( 17). In summary, NETTER-1 study demonstrated\nthat the use of ¹ ⁷⁷Lu-DOTATATE improved PFS and quality of\nlife (QoL) together with a well-disposed safety pro ﬁle.\nAnother alternative radiolabeled synthetic somatostatin\nanalogue DOTATOC (Edotreotid e) has been developed for the\nimaging and treatment of GEP-NETs The in vivo pharmacokinetics\nof the Lu-177-labeled peptides DOTATATE, DOTANOC, and\nDOTATOC have been investigate d in patients with GEP-NETs\n(18). This study demonstrated f avorable pharmacokinetic\nproperties of radiolabeled DOTATOC with a more rapid\nclearance from healthy organs compared to DOTATATE and\nDOTANOC, providing a high tumor to background ratio and\nhence a high targeted dose of radiation to the tumor.\nTheﬁrst systematic evaluation of treatment data with n.c.a. Lu-\n177-Edotreotide in patients with GEP-NETs was reported by Baum\net al. ( 19).

In the total\npopulation, median PFS and OS were 17,4 and 34,2 months,respectively. In the subjects who had received more than one\ncycle of treatment, median PFS was 32,0 months for all and 34,5\nmonths for GEP-NETs, with median OS of 34,7 months for both\ngroups. No serious adverse event s were noted, with no evidence of\nrenal toxicity. In addition, a long -term safety follow-up of patients\nincluded in the retrospective study showed no lasting relevant\nhematotoxic effects and no long-term renal toxicity for up to 6\nyears after the 1stPRRT. At the present time, it is standard practice\nto provide renal protection with a 2,5% lysine/arginine infusion\nwhich is given concomitantly with the PRRT infusion ( 20).\nBased on the data from the study of Baum et al. ( 19), a\nPhase-III pivotal clinical trial, COMPETE has been initiated.\nCOMPETE is a prospective, randomized, open-label multi-\ncenter Phase III study to evaluate the safety and ef ﬁcacy of\nn.c.a.

13E advanced RAG,What are the benefits of PRRT?,english,general,advantages of therapy,claude-3-opus-20240229 advanced RAG,"According to the provided context, the main benefits of Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT) are:

1. Tumor control: PRRT can effectively reduce tumor growth in neuroendocrine tumor (NET) patients. In the NETTER-1 trial, PRRT with 177Lu-DOTATATE showed a significantly longer progression-free survival compared to octreotide LAR (28 vs 8.5 months) [27,30,38].

2. Symptom control: PRRT can lead to symptomatic improvement in NET patients, including associated hormonal syndromes. In the NETTER-1 trial, time to quality of life deterioration was significantly longer in the 177Lu-DOTATATE group compared to the control group (29 vs 6.1 months) [38]. Overall symptom improvement was observed in 47% of patients in one study [33].

3. Effectiveness in functioning NETs: PRRT has shown to be an effective treatment for symptom control and reducing circulating hormone levels in patients with functioning NET syndromes, such as carcinoid syndrome, insulinoma, gastrinoma, glucagonoma, and VIPoma [40,41,42,43].","['Int.

Clin. Med. 2021 ,10, 1267 2 of 15\n(SSTR). For many years, evidence of an anti-tumor effect of PRRT were only obtained from\nnon-randomized Phase II trials or retrospective studies. The NETTER-1 Phase III Random-\nized Trial finally validated this treatment option by confirming its low toxicity but also its\neffectiveness in tumor control. Following these results,177Lu-DOTATATE was approved by\nthe US Food and Drug Administration in 2018 and the European Medicines Agency in 2017\nfor the treatment of gastroenteropancreatic NETs that are well differentiated and obtain a\nprescription authorization in France in metastatic midgut NETs [ 2]. Some interesting data\nexist for pancreatic and pulmonary NETs. In this review, we discuss the clinical efficiency of\nPRRT in gastroenteropancreatic and pulmonary NETs.\n2. Somatostatin Receptors (SSTR) and Radio-Labelled Somatostatin Analogues\nEffect of PRRT is correlated with the ability for the markers to ﬁx the SSTR (SSTR1-5).\nThis therapy is therefore dedicated to NETs who strongly over expressed those receptors.\nSSTRs belong to a family of G-protein coupled receptors with seven transmembrane\ndomains. The majority of well differentiated gastroenteropancreatic and pulmonary NETs\nare characterized by the strong expression of SSTR, including SSTR2 Grade 1/2 NETs\nexpress the SSTR more often and at higher levels than grade 3 NETs. When linked to the\nreceptors, radiolabeled somatostatin analogues are internalized according to the normal\nrecycling dynamics of membrane receptors and the degradation products of peptides\nare stored in lysosomes, in intracellular, which allows for the release and retention of\nradioactivity inside tumor cells [ 3]. This mechanism accounts for the low toxicity of the\nPRRT on the healthy cells. Radiolabelled somatostatin analogs are made up of an isotope\nradionuclide, a carrier molecule (derived from octreotide), and a chelating agent that binds\nthem together and stabilizes the complex. The commonly used chelating agents are DOTA\n(DOTA acid and tetra-azacyclododecane-tetra-acetic) and DTPA (di-ethylenetriamine penta-\naceticacid). Three radionucleides (111In,90Y and177Lu) were conjugated to the somatostatin\nanalogues and their different physical characteristics confer speciﬁc advantages. The90Y\nand177Lu emit beta particles with higher energy and longer ranges, which translates into\ngreater therapeutic potential. Due to the emission of gamma rays, the177Lu can also be\nused for dosimetry and monitoring of tumor response [4].\n3. Modalities of Realization and Patients Selection\nPRRT is the single validated treatment option in the NETs, which for there is a pre-\ndictive marker of answer: the expression of SSTR. Response rates have been shown to\nbe increased in patients with a higher degree of absorption of radiotracers in the case of\n111In-pentetreotid scintigraphy An overall response rate of approximately 60% has been\nreported in patients with a grade 4 according to the Krenning score, corresponding to a tu-\nmor absorption greater than that of the spleen, and kidneys. Intense ﬁxation (SUV) greater\nthan 16 on the68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT is a predictive marker of high tumor response\n(sensitivity: 95%; specﬁcity: 60 %) [ 5] (Figure 1). The effectiveness of PRRT is correlated\nwith the tumor volume and the location of the primary tumor (amount of SSTR present\non the tumor cell) (Figure 2). Thus, NETs with high liver tumor volume are considered\nto be less sensitive to PRRT [ 6]. Similarly, it is suggested that pancreatic NETs frequently\nrespond to the PRRT but with an earlier progression than in midgut NETs. The treatment\nmodalities are relatively standardized in France with a treatment carried out by infusion\nof radiolabel split in four cycles spaced eight weeks apart.', 'Cancers 2022 ,14, 5792 4 of 17\n3.2. Symptom Control\nPRRT is not only effective in reducing tumor growth, but it can also lead to symp-\ntomatic improvement in NET patients, including associated hormonal syndromes [37].

- PRRT kann Toxizitäten verursachen, die dosislimitierend sein können und Anpassungen des Behandlungsplans erfordern. Die kritischen Organe für dosislimitierende Toxizitäten sind die Nieren und das Knochenmark [1].

- Milde und schwere Hepatotoxizität wurde bei 12% bzw. 0,4-2,5% der Patienten nach PRRT beobachtet [1]. 

- Bei NET-Patienten mit hormonellen Syndromen, die eine Indikation zur Fortsetzung der SSA-Anwendung haben, muss der Zeitpunkt der Injektionen an die PRRT-Zyklen angepasst werden. Langwirksame SSA sollten aufgrund von Interferenzen mit dem radioaktiv markierten SSA nicht innerhalb von 4-6 Wochen vor einem PRRT-Zyklus verabreicht werden [2].

- Pseudo-Progression ist ein Phänomen, das bei der Beurteilung des Ansprechens berücksichtigt werden sollte, wenn während oder kurz nach der Behandlung mit PRRT eine Zunahme der Tumorgröße zu beobachten ist [2].

At patient discharge, the radiation exposure should be\nmeasured and patients should receive tailored advice on the duration of radiation safety\nprecautions at home, to avoid a high radiation exposure to other people, particularly children\nand pregnant women. Patients with NET-associated hormonal syndromes who have an\nindication for continuation of SSA use should adjust the moment of the injections to the\nPRRT cycles. Long-acting SSA should not be given within 4–6 weeks before a cycle of PRRT\nbecause of interference with the radiolabeled SSA. Although there is conflicting evidence\nfrom two limited single center studies whether continuation of SSA treatment is beneficial in\nnon-functioning NETs [ 63,64], this practice is often adopted. If the patient suffers from severe\nhormonal symptoms, short-acting SSA can be used to bridge this period up till 24 h before\nPRRT. Radiopharmaceuticals such as177Lu-DOTATATE need to be administered at specialized\nfacilities by medical personnel trained in radiation safety. These facilities should adhere to\nnational and international regulations on the use of radiopharmaceuticals and be licensed by\nthe regulatory authorities. Depending on local protocol and exposure regulations, PRRT with\n177Lu-DOTATATE can be given in an in-patient as well as an out-patient setting. In between\ncycles, patients should be reviewed for adverse effects, including full blood count and renal\nand liver function. Response evaluation by cross-sectional imaging is usually performed 2–3\nand 6 months after the last cycle of PRRT. Long-term follow-up is determined on an individual\nbasis taking into account the tumor biology and therapeutic response [ 65]. Pseudo-progression\nis a phenomenon that should be considered in the response evaluation when an increase in\ntumor size is seen during or short after treatment with PRRT. Pseudo-progression is probably\nbased on localized, temporarily edema caused by inflammation as a response to PRRT and\ndoes not show the actual tumor response to the therapy [ 58]. When pseudo-progression is\nsuspected, functional imaging (for example, PET/CT) can help differentiate between true\nprogression and pseudo-progression [31].\n5. Salvage PRRT\nIn NET patients who showed tumor response at least 18 months after the first cycle of\n177Lu-DOTATATE, re-treatment with PRRT (R-PRRT) with two additional cycles of 7.4 GBq\neach after renewed PD has shown antitumoral effects. In a meta-analysis on the effect of\nR-PRRT, the pooled median PFS was 14 months with a pooled median OS of 27 months.\nSimilarly, the pooled ORR was 17% with a disease control rate of 77%. Response rates,\nPFS and OS were lower than for initial PRRT [ 66], nonetheless R-PRRT remains a potential\noption for GEP-NET patients when other systemic treatment options are limited. The limited\nefficacy of R-PRRT as compared to initial PRRT might be explained by the administration\nof lower cumulative activity (i.e., generally half of the initial PRRT dosage) [ 51], the increase\nin tumor bulk at baseline before R-PRRT and potential changes in the tumor biology, such\nas a longitudinal increase in Ki-67. In the largest study to date by van der Zwan et al., no\ndifference in toxicity after R-PRRT as compared with initial PRRT was observed, particularly\nno increased occurrence of nephrotoxicity or significant hematological disease [ 67]. In cases\nwhere R-PRRT has provided additional benefit on tumor response and prolonged PFS, further\nre-treatment at the time of progression can be considered [67].\n6. Patient Selection\nPRRT with177Lu-DOTATATE is registered for patients with GEP-NETs that are pro-\ngressive on SSA treatment.', 'PRRT is only applicable for pa-\ntients with a Karnofsky Performance Scale of at least 60 [ 27]. PRRT is contra-indicated\nfor patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding, patients with severe cardiac impairment\n(NYHA III or IV) and those with a life expectancy less than 3 months [ 31]. Since PRRT\ncan induce toxicity, the following pre-treatment laboratory values are required: creatinine\nclearance > 40 mL/min, hemoglobin levels ≥6 mmol/L, leukocytes > 2 ×109/L, platelet\ncount > 75 ×109/L, bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) and aspartate aminotrans-\nferase (ASAT) < 3 times the upper limit of normal and albumin > 3 g/dL [2,3].\n8. PRRT-Related Toxicity\nAdverse events related to PRRT are frequently mild and include nausea, abdominal pain\nand asthenia [ 27,50]. Increased hair loss is observed in up to 60% of patients treated with\n177Lu-DOTATATE, but this is temporary and seldom leads to baldness [ 88]. Besides these\nmild adverse events, PRRT can induce more severe toxicities which can be dose-limiting and\nadjustments to the treatment schedule might be required [ 89]. When the toxicity has subsided\nwithin 16 weeks after the last dose, guidelines advise to administer half of the original activity\nof177Lu-DOTATATE during the next cycle. PRRT should be discontinued when the toxicity\npersists after 16 weeks or recurs after the half dose [ 3]. In the NETTER-1 trial, 7% of the\npatients received a reduced dose because of dose-limiting toxicities [ 27]. The kidneys and the\nbone marrow are the critical organs for dose-limiting toxicities.']",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1.0,0.0,0.5,146
14E advanced RAG,What are the challenges of PRRT?,english,general,challenges of therapy,claude-3-opus-20240229 advanced RAG,"According to the provided context, there are a few main challenges with Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT):

1. Not all patients show benefits from PRRT, and patients typically relapse 2-3 years after initiating treatment [1].

2. PRRT can have long-term side effects including renal failure and leukemic or myelodysplastic syndromes. The risk of severe nephrotoxicity (grade 3/4) was observed in 1.5% of patients, and cases of leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes have been reported with an estimated incidence of up to 2% [2].

3. Retreatment with extra cycles of PRRT as salvage therapy may be considered when tumor progression occurs, but the tumor response rate was less compared with initial treatment [3].

In summary, the main challenges are that the benefits are not universal, relapse commonly occurs within a few years, there are potential long-term toxicities, and retreatment is less effective than initial therapy. Strategies are being investigated to maximize PRRT's effectiveness while minimizing side effects [1].","['Salvage Treatment\nAlthough tumor response rates after initial treatment with\nPRRT are encouraging, CR is rare and eventually tumor pro-\ngression occurs in the majority of patients. Retreatment with\nextra cycles of PRRT as salvage therapy may be consideredwhen better options are not available. One study showed that\nsalvage therapy with two additional cycles of\n177Lu-octreotate\ndoes not lead to serious hematologic or nephrotoxic side ef-\nfects, but the tumor response rate was less compared with\ninitial treatment [ 50].\nAnother report showed that long PFS after the initial treat-\nment with PRRT predicts a prolonged PFS after salvage ther-apy [ 51], and argued that PRRT with\n177Lu-octreotate in the\nretreatment setting is a safe and effective option in patients\nwith metastatic GEP-NETs. For these reasons, retreatment\nseems a good option for patients who responded well after\nthe initial cycles of PRRT [ 52]. This novel and important\nconcept of salvage therapy of NET needs to be tested in large,\nprospective, and multi-center trials to contribute to evidence-\nbased findings.\nTreatment Side Effects\nPRRT is generally well-tolerated. Side effects can be divided to\nacute, subacute, and long-term side effects, as summarized inTable 4. Acute side effects are usually mild and self-limiting.\nNausea or vomiting are related to the concomitant admin-\nistration of kidney-protective amino acids. Subacute side\neffects are related to the radiopeptide itself, such as bonemarrow suppression, mild hair loss (observed with\n177Lu-\noctreotate), or, more rarely, an exacerbation of a clinicalsyndrome. The most common subacute side effect ofPRRT, occurring within 4 to 6 weeks after therapy, is bone\nmarrow suppression. Usually, the hematologic toxicity is\nmild and reversible. More serious WHO grade 3 or 4 tox-icity may occur, but this has been seen in less than 15% of\npatients [ 53].\nLong-term side effects of PRRT may include renal failure\nas well as leukemia/myelody splastic syndromes (MDS).\nBecause radiopeptides are usually reabsorbed in the proximal\ntubules, they can accumulate in the renal interstitium and in-duce inflammation and fibrosis with eventual kidney damage.\nCo-administration of positively charged amino acids results ina reduction of renal radioactive uptake, up to 40% as reportedin some studies [ 16,54]. If patients have long-standing or\npoorly controlled comorbidities such as diabetes and hyper-\ntension that affect kidney function, it is expected that there\nwould be a larger and more persistent decline in creatinine\nclearance [ 55].\nAdministration of Treatment\nFor purposes of kidney protection, positively charged amino\nacids, such as L-lysine and/or L-arginine, are co-infused to\ncompetitively inhibit the proximal tubular reabsorption ofthe radiopeptide [ 56]. This reduces the renal-absorbed dose.\nDilution of the amino acids with saline allows proper hydra-tion for the patient, an appropriate ratio to use is 25 g of aminoacid in 1 L of normal saline. Obviously, patients ’comorbidi-\nties should be taken into account (e.g., avoid volume overloadin patients with cardiac insufficiency and take care in avoidingelectrolyte imbalances with hyperosmotic solutions).\nAntiemetics can be administered before the infusion to avoidpotential nausea or vomiting. Amino acid infusion should bestarted 30 –60 min before administration of the radiopeptide\nand should be maintained over 4 h. Several amino acid pro-tective schemes have been proposed in the joint IAEA,EANM, and SNMMI practical guidelines on PRRT treatment\nof NETs [ 56].\nCurrent administration schedules comprise the most ap-\npropriate number of cycles (generally four or five) and thebest delivery frequency (8 weeks apart). This pattern allows\nthe patient to recover from the mild side effects of the ther-apy and increases its effectiveness in terms of the radiobi-\nological activity [ 57]. Radioisotope infusion should be\naround 30 min as recommended in the literature.', 'J. Clin. Med. 2021 ,10, 1267 11 of 15\n4.5.1. Subacute Effects\nPRRT is overall well tolerated with most patients experiencing only moderate toxicity.\nIn the study NETTER-1, validating the PRRT in midgut NETs, 5% of the patients discon-\ntinued treatment due to toxicity related to PRRT. Acute side effects are mainly nausea,\nvomiting, fatigue and abdominal pain. These adverse events are mainly caused by the\nsimultaneous infusion of aminoacids. Particular vigilance must be exercised with regard\nto the risk of carcinoid crisis. This event was reported in a very small minority (1%) of\npatients who received an PRRT treatment. This crisis usually appears within 48 h of the ﬁrst\ninfusion and is related to the massive release of active amines [ 34]. A myelosuppressure\nhas been described and is caused by the irradiation of the bone marrow. Bone marrow\nis particularly radiosensitive, and this toxicity does not appear to be associated to the\nexpression of SSTRs in myeloid cells. Myelosuppression generally develops four at six\nweeks after the infusion, is usually grade 1/2 and is reversible. Hematotoxic effects grade\n3 and 4 have been described in 13% and 10% of the patients receiving90Y-DOTATOC\nand177Lu-DOTATATE, respectively [ 35]. Lymphopenia is the more often reported severe\ncytopenia. Some studies have also reported that PRRT could be safely used in the case\nof diffuse metastatic bone marrow involvement, without irreversible myelosuppression,\nalthough a higher incidence of subacute transient hematologic toxicity was observed [36]\nOther toxicities have been reported, including a risk of hepatotoxicity in the patients\nwith major liver involvement. Thus, as indicated above, it is desirable to consider PRRT\nearly in the management process of the disease.\n4.5.2. Long-Term Effects\nLong-term side effects of PRRT can include renal failure and leukemic or myelodys-\nplastic syndromes.\nThe radiolabels are reabsorbed in the proximal tubules, may accumulate in the proxi-\nmal tubules in the renal interstitium and cause kidney damage. Because of its higher energy\nand longer penetration range,90Y irradiates the renal interstitium glomeruli more exten-\nsively than177Lu. In a large institutional series of 1109 patients treated with90Y-DOTATOC,\n103 patients (9%) were treated with90Y-DOTATOC with severe renal toxicity [ 7]. Nowa-\ndays, the concomitant administration positively charged aminoacids results in a reduction\nof up to 40% of the renal absorption. Despite renal protection, the median decrease of the\ncreatinine clearance is estimated to 4% per year in patients treated with177Lu-DOTATATE.\nThe risk factors for nephrotoxicity cited are diabetes and poorly controlled hypertension.\nRisk of severe nephrotoxicity (grade 3/4) was observed in only 1.5% of patients [ 37]. In\noverall, end-stage renal disease as a consequence of PRRT is extremely rare.\nCases of leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes have been reported as late-onset\nPRRT toxicity, with an estimated incidence of up to 2% [ 37,38]. Age over 70 years, cytopenia\nbefore treatment, the presence of bones metastasis, the high number of previous treatments,\nthe prior use of an alkylating agent and the radiotherapy increases the risk of secondary\nmyelodysplastic syndrome. Brieau et al. reported in a retrospective monocentric study\nconducted in a population of patients treated with PRRT and pre-treatment alkylating\nchemotherapy an increased risk late hematologic toxicity (20%; four patients out of 20) [ 39].\nThe main alkylating agent used in the NET treatment is temozolomide. The development\nof myelodysplastic syndrome or leukemia has been reported between 30 and 70 months\nafter treatment with PRRT [ 39].', 'Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2022 ,23, 1447 15 of 22\nstudies examining the feasibility, outcome, and safety of PRRT also demonstrated a PFS\ncomparable to, and in some cases superior to, that of other treatment modalities. Due to\nthe retrospective nature of these studies, the results required conﬁrmation in prospective\ntrials. According to PanNET guidelines, PRRT should even be used as a third-line therapy\nin patients with advanced locoregional disease following the failure of SSAs, everolimus,\nand/or cytotoxic chemotherapy [ 8]. Two cases were presented for third-line therapy, in\nwhich patients with metastatic PanNET (G2 Ki-67 10%) received chemotherapy or PRRT\naccording to the standard of care following SSA failure. After six cycles of STZ/5-FU (over\nnine months), the patient progressed four months later without treatment. The majority of\nparticipants preferred PRRT (38.6%, n = 32) over STZ/5-FU reinduction (26.5%, n = 22) [ 136].\nIn patients with GEP-NET G1 and G2, 177Lu-PRRT was compared to the mTOR inhibitor\neverolimus. Despite the success of 177Lu-DOTATATE PRRT, not all patients showed bene-\nﬁts, and patients typically relapsed 2–3 years after initiating treatment. As a result, various\nexperimental approaches and strategies are being investigated in order to maximize PRRT’s\neffectiveness while minimizing potential side effects [ 8]. The NETTER-1 phase III study\ndemonstrated that, in addition to improving progression-free survival, 177Lu-Dotatate\nsigniﬁcantly improves patient quality of life signiﬁcantly when compared to high-dose\noctreotide [ 137]. In the study where 229 patients randomly received Lu-DOTATATE every\neight weeks for four cycles plus 30 mg octreotide every four weeks or high-dose octreotide\n(60 mg) every four weeks alone showed a signiﬁcant reduction in tumour progression or\ndeath in the Lu-DOTATATE treatment group. According to recent investigations, the time\nto quality of life decline was substantially longer in the 177Lu-DOTATATE therapy group.\nAfter the NETTER-1 phase III trial, the 177Lu-DOTATATE treatment was approved for\nthe somatostatin receptor-positive GEP-NETs [ 138]. To begin, treatment may be continued\nafter four cycles of PRRT, depending on kidney and bone marrow tolerance, for example,\nwith a reduced radioactivity as part of the salvage therapy (Re-PRRT). Retreatment with\n177Lu-DOTATATE-based PRRT showed an optimistic survival beneﬁt with acceptable\nsafety in patients with NETs [ 139]. The administration of PRRT intra-arterially into the\nhepatic artery rather than intravenously may increase the tumour-absorbed dose in liver\nmetastases. However, intra-arterial administration is not mentioned in guidelines and is\nconsidered experimental [ 140]. Patients with hepatic dominant metastases, in particular,\nwould beneﬁt from this approach due to the increased uptake of the radiopharmaceutical\n(the so-called “ﬁrst-pass” effect). In a neoadjuvant setting, the PRRT is becoming increas-\ningly important. PRRT was associated with a signiﬁcant reduction in tumour size and the\ntumour was rendered operable in patients with inoperable PanNETs and distant (metastatic)\ndisease. In such instances, a complete response was possible [ 8]. PRRT was likely to be\nthe best treatment option in patients with advanced well-differentiated NETs in terms\nof the beneﬁt–risk ratio. Numerous nonrandomized studies of PRRT have consistently\ndemonstrated high response rates and prolonged PFS in patients with GEP-NETs. In a more\nrecent randomized phase III trial, PRRT plus the best supportive care provided a longer PFS\nthan high-dose octreotide, and did so with limited serious adverse events (SAEs) in patients\nwith advanced midgut NETs.']",2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,1.0,0.0,0.5,156

Pharm. Sci., 46, 1, 93-104, 20211.1. Diagnosis of Diseases with Radiopharma-\nceuticals\nRadiopharmaceuticals that emit gamma rays are \nused in nuclear medicine to diagnose disease and \ndetermine the condition and function of specific tis-sue and organ (Gundogdu et al., 2018). There are two standard methods to diagnose the disease with radio-pharmaceuticals:\nNon-image diagnostic applications: The radiophar -\nmaceutical is reached to the desired organ/tissue, and radioactivity is counted from outside. The radioac-tivity calculation in the organ can be calculated with the Medical Internal Radiation Dose (MIRD), and the body surface area can be calculated using Monte Carlo methods (Kovan, 2016).\nImage diagnostic applications: The radiopharma-\nceutical is reached to desired organ/tissue and the or -\ngan/tissue is imaged by various imaging systems such as gamma cameras, single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), Positron Emission Tomogra-phy (PET), SPECT/CT, and PET/CT hybrid systems  (Gundogdu et al., 2018).\n1.2. Treatment of Diseases with Radiopharma-\nceuticals\nRadiopharmaceuticals that emit alpha and beta \nrays are administered in many nuclear medicine treat-ment studies. The radiopharmaceuticals are given to the patient and kept in the target tissue/organ. They destroy diseased tissue and provide the treatment. In this way, near/healthy tissues are exposed to dose as low as possible and targeted therapy occurs (Kovan, 2016; Sivri et al., 2004). The properties of the radionu-clides used for radionuclide therapy are given in Table 3. Elemental, metabolic, pharmaceutical agents, an-tibodies, bone imaging chelates, bioreducing agents, labeled cells, liposomes, microspheres, nanoparticles and niosomes are radiolabeled with radionuclides suitable for the treatment of diseases. These have some advantages:\n•\t They\tare\tnon-invasive\ttreatment,•\t They\t show\tmedium\t and\tlong-term\t low\tside\tef-fects,\n•\t These\t agents\tare\tuseful\tbecause\tthey\tcan\tbe\ttarget-\ned.\n•\t The\tdose\tin\tnormal\ttissue\tis\tlow\tbecause\tthese\t\nagents can be absorbed in desired tissues (Sivri et \nal., 2004).\nThere are many radiopharmaceuticals that are \nused in the treatment of some diseases. The samples of \nradiopharmaceuticals are summarized below. \nClassification of Treatments Using Radiopharma-\nceutics:\n1. Radioactive iodine therapy in thyroid diseases2. Radiopharmaceutical treatment in metastatic \nbone pain\n3. Radionuclidic therapy in neuroendocrine tu-\nmors\n4. Treatment with labeled antibody5. Intra-cavitary radiocolloid therapy6. Radiation synovectomy7. Radionuclidic therapy in myeloproliferative dis-\neases\n8. Intra-arterial radionuclide therapy by radiola-\nbeled microspheres\n 1.2.1 Iodine-131 Treatment in Thyroid Diseases\nThe treatment of benign and malignant diseases \nof the thyroid can be done with Iodine-131 (I-131). \nRadioiodine therapy has been used for a long time. In treating diseases such as hyperthyroidism, I-131 ra-dionuclide settles in the thyroid tissue. It destroys the follicle cells with the beta particles it emits and stops the growth and activities of the thyroid cells. In this case, it returns the functions of the overactive thyroid gland to normal (Mumtaz et al., 2009).  In malignant diseases such as thyroid cancer, radioactive iodine therapy can also be applied to remove residual thyroid gland residues after thyroid surgery and treatment of the spread of thyroid cancers in the body. Since the dose of radioactive iodine preferred in the treatment of thyroid cancers is higher than the iodine dose in the treatment of hyperthyroidism, the patient should sleep in a room specially prepared for radioiodine', 'RG • Volume 40  Number 6  Gomes Marin et al  1719\n131I. The following iodine isotopes may be used as \ntheranostic agents (12,14):\n131I is a dual ( β- and γ-ray) emitting isotope with \na low cost and long half-life (~8 days) that is used \nfor therapy and whole-body diagnostic scanning to \nidentify remnant thyroid tissue or metastatic thy -\nroid cancer. However, it is not an ideal diagnostic \nagent owing to its γ-ray emission pattern and long \nhalf-life, which result in poor image quality and a \nrelatively high patient radiation dose.\n123I, a purely γ-ray emitter, has a more optimal \nphysical profile than 131I for diagnostic purposes \nin that it yields better image quality and involves \na lower radiation burden. Thus, this isotope is \nalso well suited for use in more recent approaches \nsuch as tomographic (SPECT) and hybrid imag-\ning in conjunction with CT (SPECT/CT). For \nthese reasons, despite its higher cost compared \nwith 131I, 123I is the most used iodine radioisotope \nfor diagnostic scintigraphy in the United States.\nIodine 124 (124I), a promising diagnostic agent, \nis a positron emitter and is therefore used in PET. \nIt is less frequently used clinically owing to its \neven higher production cost and lack of wide-\nspread availability.\nIn terms of therapeutic applications, radio-\niodine therapy with 131I remains the modality of \nchoice for treating patients with differentiated \nthyroid cancer in the postoperative setting. 131I \ntherapy can be performed by using different pro-\ntocols for different purposes, taking into account \nfactors such as initial extent of disease, surgical \nspecimen characteristics, histologic subtype, im-\naging findings, and biochemical changes, which ultimately determine the risk of disease recur-\nrence. The applications for 131I therapy, which \nmay be superimposed in the same patient, consist \nof ablation of residual normal tissue, adjuvant \ntreatment of occult disease, and treatment of \nknown local-regional or, especially, metastatic \ndisease. Posttreatment images can be acquired in \naddition to pretreatment images, which, owing to \nthe higher activity of 131I used in therapy, provide \nhigher sensitivity in the assessment of metastatic \nlesions and overall staging, particularly in cases \nof small metastatic lesions such as micronodular \nlung metastases (15). The example case in Figure \n5 illustrates the difference between pre- and post-\ntreatment images (15–17).\n131I-MIBG for Neural Crest–derived \nTumors\nRationale and Clinical Aspects.— The molecular \nanalog of norepinephrine, MIBG labeled with 131I \n(131I-MIBG), is another classic theranostic agent \nthat is suitable for gamma  camera and SPECT \nimaging, and it has been used in clinical settings \nsince 1981. 131I-MIBG enters the neuroendocrine \ncells of the sympathetic nervous system by means \nof endocytosis or diffusion and remains stored \nin neurosecretory vesicles. It has high sensitivity \n(>90%) and specificity (>95%) for the detec-\ntion of neural crest–derived (neuroectodermic) \ntumors and their secondary lesions (particularly \nin neuroblastoma, pheochromocytoma, and \nparaganglioma), complementing conventional \nimaging and indicating which tumors may benefit \nfrom radioisotopic therapy (12,18).\nLike radioiodine, 123I-MIBG facilitates better \nimaging and is suitable for SPECT and SPECT/\nCT, but at a higher cost. Recent improvements \nin SPECT/CT techniques include the use of 124I-\nMIBG for PET, which yields higher spatial reso-\nlution and accuracy. Both 123I-MIBG and 124I-\nMIBG are limited to use for diagnostic purposes \nonly, serving as imaging tracers, while 131I-MIBG \nis predominately used for therapeutics (19).']",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1.0,0.0,0.5,79

This situation is called ra-\ndioactivity or radioactive degradation (Asikoglu et al., \n2017). Radioactivity is substantial in radiopharmacy \nstudies. Radiopharmacy is a significant part of phar -\nmacy, concerned with the preparation, distribution, and administration of radioactive drugs. The develop-ment of radiopharmacy has also been begun with the discovery of radiation (Asikoglu et al., 2017; Kovan, 2016; Ozer, 2004).\nRadiopharmaceuticals are drugs and used for the \ndiagnosis and treatment of diseases (Silindir Gunay, \n2020).

Die Entwicklung zielt darauf ab, die Überlebenszeit von Patienten mit fortgeschrittenem Prostatakrebs zu verlängern und Nebenwirkungen im Vergleich zu konventionellen Therapien zu reduzieren.","['68Ga-PSMA-11 [129] and 18F-DCFPyL \n[130] recently received FDA approval and are marketed as Ga68 \nPSMA-11 and Pylarifly ®, respectively. Both 68Ga-PSMA-11 and \n18F-DCFPyL are cleared renally, leading to high bladder accumulation. \nAs this can be disadvantageous for imaging metastases proximal to the \nprostate gland [131] , new alternatives with more favorable clearance \nprofiles are in various stages of clinical evaluation, including \n18F-PSMA-1007 [132,133], 18F-CTT1057 [131] , and 18F-JK-PSMA-7 \n[134,135]. Numerous single photon computed tomography (SPECT) \nagents for detecting prostate cancer by planar imaging have been \ndeveloped in parallel to these PET agents. Among the SPECT agents to \nundergo preliminary clinical evaluation are 99mTc-MIP-1404 [83], \n99mTc-MIP-1427 [136] , 99mTc-PSMA-T4 [137] , 99mTc-PSMA-I &S [138] \nand 99mTc-EDDA/HYNIC-iPSMA [139] . As an alternative strategy, \nradiohybrid PSMA ligands incorporating fluorine-18/fluorine-19 and \nmacrocyclic radiometal chelators have been developed as theranostic \nagents that exploit the superior imaging properties of fluorine-18 [140] . Among this new class of compounds, 18F-rhPSMA-7.3 has undergone \npreliminary clinical evaluation and is under FDA review [141] . \nClinically advanced theranostic PSMA ligands \nThe first generation of PSMA-targeting agents were antibodies con-\njugated to radiometals for imaging or therapy. The 111In-labeled \nmonoclonal antibody 7E11-C5.3 [142] (marketed as ProstaScint ®) \nprovided early validation of this PSMA targeted theranostic approach in \nadvanced prostate cancer. Nevertheless, despite uptake in primary dis-\nease and metastatic lesions [142] , 7E11-C5.3 targets an intracellular \nepitope on PSMA [89], restricting its ability to bind viable cells. Sub-\nsequent development of J591, a humanized monoclonal antibody \nagainst the external domain of PSMA, stimulated renewed clinical \ninvestigation into PSMA-targeted imaging and therapy of progressive \ndisease [143] . J591 has undergone evaluation in men with metastatic \ncastration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) as an 111In-DOTA conju -\ngate for SPECT imaging [144] , an 89Zr-DFO conjugate for PET imaging \n[145] , 90Y- [146] and 177Lu-DOTA [147] conjugates for targeted \nb-particle therapy, and an 225Ac-DOTA conjugate for targeted α-particle \ntherapy [148] . Phase II clinical trials with 177Lu-J591 have been \ncompleted, in which the response rate in treated patients, defined as ≥\n50% decrease in PSA, is 11% [147] . As a result of a circulation half-life \nin excess of 1 day [144] , hematological toxicity is dose limiting [146] . \nOngoing Phase I clinical trials with 225Ac-J591 highlight response even \nin patients with prior 177Lu-J591 PSMA-targeted radiotherapy, with no \nnon-hematological grade 3/4 adverse events [149] . \nSmall molecule alternatives to J591 have proliferated following the \nidentification of a high affinity heterodimeric urea pharmacophore for \nPSMA binding [150] . The chemical structures of leading examples of \nsmall molecule PSMA inhibitors are depicted in Fig. 3. In comparison to \nmonoclonal antibodies, small molecules are excreted more rapidly, \nthereby reducing the likelihood of hematological toxicity. The majority \nof ligands to reach clinical trials incorporate a glutamate-urea-lysine \n(EuK) moiety for PSMA targeting.', 'For instance, a study of MEDI3726\n(a PSMA-targeted antibody–drug conjugate) in patients with mCRPC after failure of abiraterone or\nenzalumatide observed significant responses at higher doses of MEDI3726, although responses were not\ndurable because patients discontinued therapy due to drug-related adverse events [ 53]. Small-molecule\nPSMA inhibitors have been labeled with both beta- and alpha-emitting radioisotopes, which have variable\nenergy levels and path lengths. Beta-emitting radioisotopes, such as lutetium-177 (177Lu), are the favored\nradioisotopes given their short maximal tissue penetration and relatively long half-life, permitting delivery\nof a high degree of radiation to PCa lesions. Advantages of alpha-emitting radioisotopes include reduced\nred-marrow infiltration, leading to less hematotoxicity . In a proof-of-concept paper, application of the\nalpha-emitting225actinium (225Ac) to two patients with diffuse bone marrow involvement led to undetectable\nPSA levels in both patients and no relevant hematotoxicity [54].\nAmong alpha-emitting radioisotopes, preliminary investigations of225Ac-PSMA-617 suggest that\nit has substantial therapeutic e ﬃcacy for mCRPC. In a study of 17 chemotherapy-naive patients with\nadvanced metastatic PCa treated with225Ac-PSMA-617, 82% of patients had a PSA decline of ≥90%,\nand 41% of patients had undetectable serum PSA 12 months after therapy [ 55]. Targeted alpha-therapy', 'Cancers 2020 ,12, 1367 6 of 14\nImproved localization of metastatic PCa using PSMA-targeted imaging may also increase the\nsuccess rate of metastasis-directed therapy (MDT), including stereotactic body radiotherapy (SABR).\nMDT intends to postpone systemic treatment for patients with oligometastatic disease, thereby\nreducing the side-e ﬀects of hormonal therapy. Prospective data suggest that SABR is well tolerated\nand improves PFS in patients with oligometastatic PCa [ 50]. In the randomized STOMP study, which\nused choline PET /CT, stereotactic ablation of oligometastatic disease in 62 patients delayed the need\nfor hormonal therapy from 13 to 21 months compared with surveillance [ 51]. Data from ORIOLE, a\nsimilar randomized Phase II study investigating the e ﬃcacy of SABR in forestalling metastases for\nhormone-sensitive PCa compared with observation, provide evidence for the value of PSMA PET /CT\nin controlling disease [ 52]. Patients randomized to the SABR arm of ORIOLE underwent18F-DCFPyl\nPET/CT, a urea-based PSMA radiotracer, prior to and 180 days after treatment. Patients with no\nadditional untreated lesions detected by PSMA PET /CT at baseline were signiﬁcantly less likely to\ndevelop new metastatic lesions at six months than those whose PSMA PET /CT showed at least one\nadditional lesion at baseline (16% vs. 63%, respectively).\nCurrently, the only PSMA-targeted imaging agent approved by the U.S. Food and Drug\nAdministration is111In-capromab pendetide (ProstaScint), which is approved for SPECT imaging of\nbiopsy-proven PCa localized to the prostatic bed but at high risk for pelvic LNM. Regulatory approval\nof PSMA radiotracers in the United States has lagged behind other areas of the world, such as Europe\nand Australia, where much of the innovation in PSMA theranostics has occurred. Given the growing\nevidence of the clinical potential of PSMA, its availability is expanding in the United States, and\nregulatory approval of novel radiotracers, including68Ga-PSMA-11 and18F-DCFPyl, is expected within\nthe next year. Ongoing clinical trials will help to better deﬁne the clinical role and impact of PSMA\nimaging and possibly strengthen the case for regulatory approval (Table 1). In sum, PSMA-targeted\nimaging has demonstrated clinical beneﬁts through targeting stereotactic ablation in oligometastatic\ndisease, but no studies have yet shown that PSMA-targeted imaging improves clinical outcomes for\nbiochemically recurrent PCa patients.\n4. PSMA Radioligand Therapy (RLT)\nPSMA has also emerged as a promising therapeutic molecular target. Although various therapies are\nnow approved for mCRPC, their survival benefit is generally limited to less than 6 months. There is thus a\nclinical need for novel therapies leading to a sustained response. Progress in the development of synthetic\nPSMA radioligands has led to an emerging body of research indicating significant therapeutic efficacy of\nPSMA RLT.\nPSMA RLT studies have mostly utilized small-molecule inhibitors of PSMA as radioligands, which\nhave been shown to be less hematotoxic than monoclonal antibodies. For instance, a study of MEDI3726\n(a PSMA-targeted antibody–drug conjugate) in patients with mCRPC after failure of abiraterone or\nenzalumatide observed significant responses at higher doses of MEDI3726, although responses were not\ndurable because patients discontinued therapy due to drug-related adverse events [ 53]. Small-molecule\nPSMA inhibitors have been labeled with both beta- and alpha-emitting radioisotopes, which have variable\nenergy levels and path lengths. Beta-emitting radioisotopes, such as lutetium-177 (177Lu), are the favored\nradioisotopes given their short maximal tissue penetration and relatively long half-life, permitting delivery\nof a high degree of radiation to PCa lesions.

The MEN1 gene encodes the menin protein involved in the\nregulation of gene transcription and mutation carriers will have clinicalmanifestations by the age of 50 years. The syndrome is associated\nwith parathyroid adenomas, duodenopancreatic NET and anterior\npituitary adenomas with a lifetime prevalence of 80% for NF-Pan-NET. MEN1 syndrome associates less frequently with thymic, lung\nand gastric NET and other tumours, and it is thus important to moni-\ntor patients for other neoplasms. Early recognition of relatives withMEN1 syndrome is of outmost importance due to 50% probability offirst line family members being carriers and also in the light of possible\ngenetic anticipation.\n84\nPan-NET arising in the context of MEN1 syndrome are usually\nmultiple, nonfunctioning and may develop early in the second decade\nof life.85The current state of evidence suggests initial close follow up\nwith MRI to assess growth rate alternating with EUS. SRI-PET may becarried out when it may change management such as in NF-Pan-NET\n>1 cm for detection of occult metastases or before interventions are\nconsidered.\n86,87\nSeveral studies have indicated that MEN1-associated NF-\nPan-NET usually exhibit a low propensity to grow and lesions <2 cm\ncan be simply followed up by observation. If they are NET G2-G3,have lymph node metastases and are >3 cm in diameter, surgical exci-sion is then considered as they may display metastatic potential.\n88For\nlesions between 2 and 3 cm there is uncertainty, and more studies are\nrequired prior to being able to make recommendations.', 'Version 1.2023 © 202 3 National Comprehensive Cancer Network© (NCCN©), All rights reserved.

The PROMID cohort was randomized without an obser-vation period prior to randomization; therefore, sponta-neous tumor growth was unknown. For ethical reasons, the investigators decided to avoid randomization of pa-tients with documented tumor progression to placebo treatment. In the CLARINET trial, patients with metasta-sized gastroenteropancreatic NETs and a Ki-67 prolifera-tion index <10% were randomized to lanreotide autogel or placebo. Ninety-six percent of the patients had stable disease according to RECIST in the 3–6 months before randomization. In contrast, 50% of the patients included in the PROMID trial and randomized to receive placebo were progressive after 6 months  \n[1] . TTP in the PROMID \nstudy was 14.3 months for the octreotide and 6.0 months for the placebo group. The respective figures for PFS of the midgut subgroup in the CLARINET study were much longer: ‘not reached’ in the lanreotide and 21 months in the placebo group  \n[2] . Both trials reach identical conclu-\nsions concerning the key message: long-acting soma-tostatin analogs inhibit tumor growth and prolong TTP and PFS. However, the trials markedly differ with respect to the underlying absolute figures for TTP and PFS. The use of different response criteria (the bidimensional WHO criteria vs. the unidimensional RECIST) and the inclusion of patients with different tumor biology, espe-cially the selection of patients without disease progression before randomization into the CLARINET trial, may contribute to the obvious differences found in both trials. In future studies, tumor growth behavior at study entry should be documented.\n  To conclude, this prospectively designed study pro-\nvides for the first time long-term survival data for patients with metastatic midgut NETs. The study shows that a high tumor burden is a strong indicator for a shorter sur-vival. Patients with a low tumor burden displayed a favor-able prognosis with a median survival of 107 months after randomization.

Die ENETS Consensus Guidelines geben folgende Empfehlungen für die Therapie von metastasierten neuroendokrinen Tumoren des Gastrointestinaltrakts und Pankreas [Pavel et al., 2016]:

- Bei potenziell resektablen G1/G2 NET sollte immer eine kurative Resektion erwogen werden, auch bei Leber- und/oder Lymphknotenmetastasen. 

- Bei nicht-resektablen Tumoren kommen lokoregionale Verfahren (Embolisation, Chemoembolisation, Radioembolisation, Radiofrequenzablation) und systemische Therapien zum Einsatz.

- Somatostatinanaloga (Octreotid, Lanreotid) werden zur Symptomkontrolle und auch antiproliferativ eingesetzt.

- Weitere systemische Optionen sind Interferon alpha, Chemotherapie mit Streptozotocin/5-FU oder Temozolomid/Capecitabin, die Tyrosinkinase-Inhibitoren Everolimus und Sunitinib sowie die Peptidrezeptor-Radionuklidtherapie (PRRT).

- Bei G3 neuroendokrinen Karzinomen wird eine Platin-basierte Chemotherapie empfohlen.

Die genauen Indikationen und Bedingungen für den bevorzugten Einsatz der verschiedenen Therapien als Erstlinientherapie sind in Tabelle 1 zusammengefasst.

Ohne Informationen zu den NANETS Guidelines lässt sich anhand des gegebenen Kontextes kein Vergleich der Empfehlungen anstellen. Die ENETS Guidelines stellen aber einen umfassenden Expertenk","['ENETS Consensus Guidelines Update for \nDistant Metastatic Disease  Neuroendocrinology 2016;103:172–185 \nDOI: 10.1159/000443167181in pancreatic NET and it may be considered in G3 NET and in \nhigh-risk NET of other primary site (e.g. pulmonary NET). In G3 NEC, platinum-based chemotherapy is recommended as a first-line therapy.\n  Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy\n  PRRT is a therapeutic option in progressive SSTR-pos-\nitive NET with homogenous SSTR expression (all lesions are positive). In general, the use of PRRT follows failed first-line medical therapy. Radionuclide therapy with ei-ther  \n90 Y and/or  177 Lu-labeled SSA is most frequently used \nin NET, but  177 Lu-labelled SSA is increasingly used due\nto lower kidney toxicity. The minimum requirementsfor PRRT are reported in a separate consensus guideline  \n[84] . Until recently, there were no results from prospec-\ntive randomized trials available. The registrational trialof  \n177 Lu-DOTATATE in progressive midgut NET\n(NETTER-1) has reached its primary endpoint with a sig-nificant prolongation of PFS compared to high-dose oc-treotide (60 mg/month). Based on this trial, and cumula-tive data from prospective and retrospective trials over the last 15 years, PRRT may be recommended in midgut NET as a second-line therapy after failure of SSA if the general requirements for applying PRRT are fulfilled  \n[84–\n87]  or as a third-line therapy after failure of everolimus. \n  Given the different established and approved therapeu-\ntic options in pancreatic NET and the lack of a prospective trial with PRRT in pancreatic NET, PRRT (if available) is in general recommended in G1/G2 NET after failure of medical therapy including SSA, chemotherapy or novel targeted drugs. However, potential increasing toxicity, e.g. after prior chemotherapy or targeted therapy, needs to be considered, requires close surveillance and might justify an earlier use of PRRT in selected patients ( table\xa01 ).\n  Minimal Consensus Statement \n \nPRRT is recommended after failure of medical therapy. Data \nfrom a prospective trial in midgut NET support its role as a second-line therapy option in intestinal NET if the general requirements for PRRT are fulfilled and as an alternative option to everolimus. The optimal sequencing with targeted drugs and/or chemotherapy needs to be defined in pancreatic NET when data from prospective randomized trials with PRRT in pancreatic NET become available.\n  Management of NET with Unknown Primary Tumor \n In approximately 13% of patients who are diagnosed \nas having NEN, the primary site is not known. In patients with unknown primary tumor, the site is most frequently localized in the intestine or the lung. Additional tools \nshould be exploited to identify the primary tumor. These include immunohistochemistry of transcription factors (CDX-2, Islet-1, TTF-1)  \n[88] , PET/CT (e.g.  Ga 68-SR,  11 C-\n5-hydroxytryptophan or  18 F-DOPA)  [89, 90]   and upper \nand lower gastrointestinal endoscopy and optionally cap-sule endoscopy  \n[91, 92]  . If the primary tumor site remains \nunknown, therapeutic decision making is essentially based on grading, functionality, SSTR status, tumor ex-tent and hepatic tumor burden.\n  Further information is provided in the consensus \nguideline updates for other GEP NET [ \n83, 93–97  , this is-\nsue].\n  Appendix \n All Other Vienna Consensus Conference Participants    \nAnlauf, M.

This is especially true for surgical treatment, different locoregional or ablative therapies [emboliza-tion, chemoembolization, radiofrequency ablation and selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT)] and system-ic chemotherapy. Somatostatin analogues (SSA) and novel targeted drugs, such as the multiple tyrosine ki-nase inhibitor sunitinib and the mTOR inhibitor evero-limus, are the only drugs that have been evaluated in NEN within placebo-controlled trials. Based on the re-sults of these trials, SSA, sunitinib and everolimus have been approved and registered for antiproliferative ther-apy in different neuroendocrine tumor (NET) subtypes excluding neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC). Recent data from a placebo-controlled trial with lanreotide (CLARINET study) in enteropancreatic NET have pro-vided novel evidence for the antiproliferative activity of SSA. Furthermore, it has recently been reported that \nthree large randomized controlled drug trials (i.e. evero-limus vs. placebo in lung and intestinal NET and NET of unknown primary tumor, RADIANT-4;  \n177 Lu-\nDOTATATE vs. high-dose octreotide in midgut NET, NETTER-1, and telotristat etiprate vs. placebo in refrac-tory carcinoid syndrome, TELESTAR) have reached their primary endpoints  \n[10–12]  .

In addition, there is novel information available on the use of targeted drugs from application outside of ran-domized clinical trials. \n  Given the variety of treatment options, the heteroge-\nneity of NEN and the individual disease complexity, it is strongly recommended if not mandatory to discuss NEN patients after accurate imaging and pathology review in a multidisciplinary tumor board for appropriate therapeu-tic decision making, especially to exploit surgical therapy (a) Simple pattern of LMs\nG1/G2\n(unilobar or limited)Resection of primary\n(b) Complex pattern of LMs\nG1/G2\n(bilobar)Morphological and\nfunctional imaging\n(c) Diffuse LMs\nG1/G2\nOr surgery\ncontraindicated\nSurgery\ncontraindicatedResection\n(minor or\nanatomical)One-step surgery\nMajor liver\nresection ± RFATwo-step surgery(1) Minor resection   ± RFA, RPVE, RPVL\n(2) Sequential major\n   liver resectionSmall intestinal- SSA (IFN)- PRRT\n- EverolimusPancreatic\n- SSA (IFN)- Chemotherapy\n- Everolimus\n- Sunitinib\n- PRRTSelected cases\n(<1%)\nTACE, TAE\nSIRT*Ablation\n(RFA, LiTT)\nTACE, TAE\nSIRT*Liver\ntransplantation\n  Fig. 1.

Choosing antiproliferative therapies is also challenging depending on the tumor pri-mary, its functional status, its growth rate, grade and overall disease burden and the goal of individual thera-pies within the patient’s choice and status.

Recommendations for the preferential use of targeted drugs or chemotherapy as first-line thera-py are summarized in  table\xa01 .\n  This review focuses on intestinal and pancreatic NEN, \nand it provides a therapeutic algorithm for both subtypes ( fig.\xa02, 3 ). The management of typical and atypical lung NET is similar to that of gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) NEN taking into consideration pathological features (mi-totic count, Ki-67), somatostatin receptor (SSTR) expres-sion, growth rate and disease extent. The best practice recommendations for the management of typical and atypical bronchial NET are reported in a separate recent-ly published ENETS consensus paper  \n[13] .  Therapeutic Options \n In grade 1 (G1) and G2 NET, surgery with curative in-\ntent always has to be considered, even if liver and/ or lymph node metastases are present ( fig.\xa01 ). In non-resect-able disease, the following treatment options should be considered to control symptoms secondary to the hyper-secretion of peptide hormones/amines leading to a func-tional syndrome (carcinoid syndrome, diarrhea and oth-er symptoms related to functionally active pancreatic NEN) and/or tumor growth control.

Recommendations are given according to the best availableevidence and authors' experience and will have a level of evidence\n(1–5) and strength of recommendation (A –D) (Table\n2) as per the\nGRADE system.1\nThe incidence of Pan-NET is rising, most recently reported as\n0.48 per 100,000 new cases per year according to the Surveillance,\nEpidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Programme; although Pan-NET\ncarry an unfavourable prognosis compared to NET from other primarysites, an improvement in overall survival (OS) has been observed over\ntime (median OS of 3.6 years), particularly in patients with distant\nmetastases.\n2\nThe majority (between 50% and 85%) of Pan-NET are nonfunc-\ntioning. Moreover, NF-Pan-NET tend to present with more advanced\ndisease (more advanced tumour [T]-stage, lymph node involvementand liver metastases) and arise in the head of the pancreas. Conse-\nquently, patients with NF-Pan-NET have a significantly worse OS than\ntheir functioning counterparts ( p< .001).\n3,4\nIn patients undergoing curative resection, a shorter survival\nwas observed in patients with NF-Pan-NET, lymphatic invasion,\nand size >10 cm, while a shorter disease-free survival (DFS)\nwas associated with advanced pT-stage (pT3 –4), size >5 cm and\nhistological grade (G) 2 –3. Ki-67 > 10% predicted a poorer\nprognosis.52|DIAGNOSIS\n2.1 |Q1. How should we define and characterise a\nNF-Pan-NET at presentation?\nWhile the diagnosis of functionality relies on the presence of a\nhormonal syndrome, the NET-diagnosis relies on histological or cyto-\nlogical analysis. Histopathological diagnosis is based on the neuroen-docrine growth pattern, including nesting, trabecular, gyriform and\nsolid architecture, as well as the expression of neuroendocrine\nmarkers including synaptophysin and chromogranin A (CgA).\n6It should\nbe noted that in the pancreas, especially acinic cell carcinoma, solidpseudopapillary neoplasm and paraganglioma can be positive for\nthese markers, and therefore they should be actively excluded.\n7More\nrecently, the transcription factor INSM1 has emerged as a both sensi-tive and specific diagnostic mar ker of NET. Grading is assessed by\nTABLE 1 Ten major questions on management of nonfunctioning\npancreatic neuroendocrine tumours.\nQ1 How should we define and characterise a NF-Pan-NET\npatient at clinical presentation?\nQ2 Which biochemical tests should be performed in a patient\nwith NF-Pan-NET?\nQ3 Which is the most suitable imaging work-up for NF-Pan-NET\npatients?\nQ4 What is the appropriate surgical management of NF-Pan-\nNET?\nQ5 What is the role of PRRT in patiente with NF-Pan-NET?Q6 What is the role of biotherapy and molecular targeted\ntherapies in patients with advanced NF-Pan-NET?\nQ7 What is the role of chemotherapy in patients with advanced\nNF-Pan-NET?\nQ8 In the setting of advanced disease, which is the most suitable\nfirst-line systemic therapy?

SSR -based PET imaging \nshould include PET/CT or PET/MRI of the skull base to mid -thigh with IV \ncontrast (both arterial and portal venous phase), when possible. Data are limited on the optimal timing of SSR scans following administration of \nsomatostatin analogs. FDG -PET/CT scans can be performed as \nappropriate if SSR PET imaging is negative. There are some instances where FDG PET is useful in patients with positive SSR PET. Biochemical  \nevaluation should be performed if the patient has symptoms suggestive of a secretory tumor. Pathology review is recommended and assessment of \np53, Rb, and p16, by histopathologic analysis or molecular profiling, can \nbe considered if there is uncertainty about the tumor’s degree of \ndifferentiation, as a mutation in these genes would suggest a poorly \ndifferentiated NEC.\n282-284 SSR 2A staining may also be helpful.285 Genetic \ncounseling and testing for inherited genet ic syndromes is recommended \nonly for duodenal or pancreatic NETs.  \nPrimary Treatment of Well -Differentiated Grade 3 Neuroendocrine Tumors  \nTreatment recommendations are based on the biology of the tumor. A \ntumor with favorable biology typically possesses Ki -67 less than 55%, is \nslow- growing, and may yield a positive SSR -based PET result. A tumor \nwith unfavorable biology typically has Ki -67% greater than or equal to \n55%, is faster -growing, and may yield a negative SSR -based PET result.  \nImportantly, the data informing the appropriate Ki -67 cutoff are limited and \nvariability/heterogeneity of Ki -67 in a given tumor and over time in serial \nbiopsies  make decision- making less straightforward in this entity \ncompared to other NENs. The combination of clinical course and histopathologic workup should dictate therapy, not solely Ki -67. For \nlocoregional (resectable) disease, resection is recommended, along  with \nregional lymphadenectomy, if feasible, regardless of tumor biology.286 \nPatient factors should be considered.  \nFor resectable locoregional disease with unfavorable biology, a clinical \ntrial is preferred. Neoad juvant chemotherapy can also be given on a case -\nby-case basis and options include temozolomide with or without \ncapecitabine, oxaliplatin- based therapy (FOLFOX or CAPEOX), \ncisplatin/etoposide, or carboplatin/etoposide. Temozolomide may have \nmore activity in  tumors arising in the pancreas. Following the completion of \nneoadjuvant chemotherapy, the patient should undergo resection with regional lymphadenectomy if feasible.  \nFor resectable locally advanced or metastatic disease with favorable \nbiology, resection of the primary and metastatic sites may be performed, if \nfeasible. The treatment for unresectable locally advanced or metastatic \ntumors depends on the degree of tumor burden. If the patient is \nasymptomatic with low tumor burden, observation with a short interval \nfollow- up scan is an option for select patients; otherwise, octreotide or \nlanreotide is recommended if the patient is SSR -positive and/or has \nhormonal symptoms. There are multiple treatment modalities if the patient \nhas a clinically significant tumo r burden or evidence of disease \nprogression. Octreotide or lanreotide is recommended if the patient is \nSSR-positive and/or has hormonal symptoms.

For many years, evidence of an anti-tumor effect of PRRT were only obtained from\nnon-randomized Phase II trials or retrospective studies. The NETTER-1 Phase III Random-\nized Trial finally validated this treatment option by confirming its low toxicity but also its\neffectiveness in tumor control. Following these results,177Lu-DOTATATE was approved by\nthe US Food and Drug Administration in 2018 and the European Medicines Agency in 2017\nfor the treatment of gastroenteropancreatic NETs that are well differentiated and obtain a\nprescription authorization in France in metastatic midgut NETs [ 2]. Some interesting data\nexist for pancreatic and pulmonary NETs. In this review, we discuss the clinical efficiency of\nPRRT in gastroenteropancreatic and pulmonary NETs.\n2. Somatostatin Receptors (SSTR) and Radio-Labelled Somatostatin Analogues\nEffect of PRRT is correlated with the ability for the markers to ﬁx the SSTR (SSTR1-5).\nThis therapy is therefore dedicated to NETs who strongly over expressed those receptors.\nSSTRs belong to a family of G-protein coupled receptors with seven transmembrane\ndomains. The majority of well differentiated gastroenteropancreatic and pulmonary NETs\nare characterized by the strong expression of SSTR, including SSTR2 Grade 1/2 NETs\nexpress the SSTR more often and at higher levels than grade 3 NETs. When linked to the\nreceptors, radiolabeled somatostatin analogues are internalized according to the normal\nrecycling dynamics of membrane receptors and the degradation products of peptides\nare stored in lysosomes, in intracellular, which allows for the release and retention of\nradioactivity inside tumor cells [ 3]. This mechanism accounts for the low toxicity of the\nPRRT on the healthy cells. Radiolabelled somatostatin analogs are made up of an isotope\nradionuclide, a carrier molecule (derived from octreotide), and a chelating agent that binds\nthem together and stabilizes the complex. The commonly used chelating agents are DOTA\n(DOTA acid and tetra-azacyclododecane-tetra-acetic) and DTPA (di-ethylenetriamine penta-\naceticacid). Three radionucleides (111In,90Y and177Lu) were conjugated to the somatostatin\nanalogues and their different physical characteristics confer speciﬁc advantages. The90Y\nand177Lu emit beta particles with higher energy and longer ranges, which translates into\ngreater therapeutic potential. Due to the emission of gamma rays, the177Lu can also be\nused for dosimetry and monitoring of tumor response [4].\n3. Modalities of Realization and Patients Selection\nPRRT is the single validated treatment option in the NETs, which for there is a pre-\ndictive marker of answer: the expression of SSTR. Response rates have been shown to\nbe increased in patients with a higher degree of absorption of radiotracers in the case of\n111In-pentetreotid scintigraphy An overall response rate of approximately 60% has been\nreported in patients with a grade 4 according to the Krenning score, corresponding to a tu-\nmor absorption greater than that of the spleen, and kidneys. Intense ﬁxation (SUV) greater\nthan 16 on the68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT is a predictive marker of high tumor response\n(sensitivity: 95%; specﬁcity: 60 %) [ 5] (Figure 1). The effectiveness of PRRT is correlated\nwith the tumor volume and the location of the primary tumor (amount of SSTR present\non the tumor cell) (Figure 2). Thus, NETs with high liver tumor volume are considered\nto be less sensitive to PRRT [ 6]. Similarly, it is suggested that pancreatic NETs frequently\nrespond to the PRRT but with an earlier progression than in midgut NETs. The treatment\nmodalities are relatively standardized in France with a treatment carried out by infusion\nof radiolabel split in four cycles spaced eight weeks apart.', 'If GEP-NETS are resectable, surgery is the primary ap-\nproach. Patients with unresectable metastatic disease usually\ngo through multiple lines of treatments including somatostatin\nanalogue (SSA) therapy or targeted therapy, such as everoli-mus (mTOR inhibitor) or sunitinib (tyrosine kinase inhibitor)\n[7]. In patients with grade 1 and 2 NETs (Ki-7 LI of up to\n20%) that are inoperable and metastatic, who have failed first-\nline somatostatin treatment, and whose tumors express high\nlevels of somatostatin receptors (SSTRs), peptide receptor ra-\ndionuclide therapy (PRRT) would be a viable option. PRRTusually involves DOTATOC, DOTATATE, and DOTANOC\nlabeled either with\n90Yor177Lu [7]. Patients included in study\nprotocols have positive NET histology and SSTR scintigraphy\nwith111In OctreoScan or68Ga PET-Dota-peptide (Fig. 1). A\npositive scan denotes lesion uptake that is equal to or greaterthan the liver uptake [ 8]. Important criteria to be taken into\naccount when considering PRRT include objective disease\nprogression, adequate blood profile (hemoglobin, white cell,\nand platelet count levels), creatinine, and ECOG performancescore ≤2[8]. A good performance status means the patient\nwould be self-sufficient and reduces the need for physicalassistance during the treatment period (3 days/cycle).Recently published European Society for Medical Oncology\n(ESMO) Clinical Practice Guidelines have recommended\nPRRT up to the upper limit of Ki-67 LI to 30% [ 9].\nScintigraphic or PET tomoscintigraphic evaluation is to datethe most accurate noninvasive method to identify and confirmthe overexpression of functioning receptors [ 10]. An impor-\ntant issue in the consideration of PRRT is that the somatostatinreceptors should be functional, i.e., able to internalize the re-ceptor analogue complex and retain the radioactivity inside\nthe cell. The critical issues for effective therapy are somato-\nstatin receptor overexpression and the evidence of functional-ity. The nuclear physician can calculate a tumor-to-liver ratio\nas a relative measure of receptor number [ 11]; this ratio must\nbe high for PRRT eligibility.Mechanism of Action and Constituents\nof Radiolabeled SSAs\nSomatostatin ’s actions include inhibiting hormone secretion,\nsuppressing the release of insulin-like growth factors,\ninhibiting angiogenesis, and inducing apoptosis in the tumor\ntissue [ 12]. Such biologic effects are mediated through inter-\naction with five subtypes of somatostatin receptors (SSTR1-\n5), which belong to the seven-transmembrane domain, G-\nprotein-coupled receptor superfamily. The currently approvedSSAs are octreotide and lanreotide, in slow-release formula-\ntions, long-acting release (LAR), and supersaturated solution\n(Autogel®).\nDue to the overexpression of SSTRs in NETs, which is\nestimated to be in around 80% of NETs, they are consideredsuitable targets for PRRT with radiolabeled SSA. Once boundto their receptor, radiolabeled SSAs are internalized as per\nnormal receptor recycling dynamics, and the breakdown prod-\nucts of the radiolabeled peptides are stored in lysosomes, thusenabling delivery and causing suspension of radioactivity in-\nside the tumor cell [ 13]. This would result in radiation-induced\nDNA damage of the tumor cell and its eventual death.\nRadiolabeled SSAs are made up of three main constituents;\na radionuclide isotope, a ligand or carrier molecule (TOC or\nTATE), and a chelator or linker (DOTA) that binds them to-\ngether and stabilizes the complex (Fig. 2). Chelators mainly\nused include DOTA (tetraazacyclododecane tetra-acetic acid)\nand DTPA (diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid), while\noctreotide and octreotate (TOC and TATE, respectively) are\ngenerally used as ligands [ 14]. The most known and studied\nSSA is octreotide.']",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1,1.0,0.0,0.5,50

Their incidence and prevalence are continuously rising1. Current \nstandard treatment options for metastasized GEP-NETs include somatostatin (SST) \nanalogs (due to NETs strongly expressing SST receptors) and targeted drugs such \nas the mTOR inhibitor everolimus and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib. While \nthese treatments rarely induce objective tumor remission, disease stabilization may \nbe achieved for a limited time, for instance, median progression free survival (mPFS) \nwith everolimus in prospective phase III trials is 11 months2. Some patients may also \nbene/f_i  t from systemic chemotherapy.\nPeptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT) uses IV-infused radiolabeled ligands to \ndeliver cytotoxic dose of radiation to tumor cells while sparing the surrounding tissue. \nThis therapy is emerging as a promising option, providing more durable response and \npotentially higher objective response rates than currently approved therapies. PRRT \nwith 177Lu-DOTATATE has increased PFS and achieved higher response rates than high \ndose octreotide in patients with advanced SSTR+ midgut NETs3. These results call for \nadditional prospective, randomized and controlled study of other PRRTs in SSTR+ NETs \nof the midgut and other locations.\nLutetium (177Lu) edotreotide (177Lu-DOTATOC), tested in the COMPETE trial, is an \ninnovative octreotide-derived somatostatin analog containing the chelator DOTA \nradiolabeled with the medical radioisotope lutetium (177Lu). Its favorable safety pro/f_i  le \nand promising eﬃ   cacy have been demonstrated in a phase II study in 56 patients4. \nLutetium (177Lu) edotreotide PRRT in metastasized GEP-NETs achieved a median PFS \nof 34.5 months in patients who received ≥2 treatment cycles (Figures 1 and 2). The \nCOMPETE trial is the /f_i  rst to undertake a direct comparison of PRRT vs. an approved \ntherapeutic.\nMethod\nTrial design\nCOMPETE is a prospective, randomized, controlled, open-label, multi-center, phase III \nclinical trial to evaluate the eﬃ   cacy and safety of lutetium (177Lu) edotreotide PRRT \ncompared to targeted molecular therapy with everolimus in patients with inoperable,  \nprogressive,  somatostatin  receptor-positive  (SSTR+)  GEP-NETs.

[2]","['About Targeted Radionuclide Therapy  \nTargeted Radionuclide Therapy is an emerging class of cancer therapeutics, which seeks to deliver \nradiation directly to the tumor while minimizing radiation exposure to normal tissue. Targeted \nradiopharmaceuticals are created by linking a therapeutic radioisotope to a targeting molecule (e.g., peptide, antibo dy, small molecule) that can precisely recognize tumor cells and bind to tumor -specific \ncharacteristics, like receptors on the tumor cell surface . As a result, the radioisotope accumulates at \nthe tumor site and decays, releasing a small amount of ionizing radiation, thereby destroying tumor  \ntissue . The highly precise localization enables targeted treatment with minimal impact to healthy \nsurrounding tissue.  \n \nAbout ITM -11 (n.c.a. \n177Lu-edotreotide ) \nITM-11, ITM’s therapeutic  radiopharmaceutical  candidate  being  investigated in the phase III clinical \nstudies COMPETE and COMPOSE,  consists of two components: the medical radioisotope no -carrier -\nadded lutetium -177 (n.c.a. 177Lu) and the targeting molecule e dotreotide, a synthetic form of the \npeptide hormone somatostatin that targets neuroendocrine tumor -specific receptors.  Edotreotide \nbinds to these receptors and places the medical radioisotope n.c.a. l utetium -177 directly onto the \ndiseased neuroendocrine cells so that it accumulates at the tumor site. N.c.a.  lutetium -177 is \ninternalized into the tumor cells and decays, releasing medical radiation (ionizing β -radiation) with a \nmaximum radius of 1.7 mm and destroying tumor  tissue . The highly precise localization can result in \nthe healthy tissue surrounding the targeted tumor being minimally affected.  \n ITM Isotope Technologie s Munich SE  \nITM, a radiopharmaceutical biotech company, is dedicated to providing the most precise cancer \nradiotherapeutics and diagnostics to meet the needs of patients, clinicians and our partners through \nexcellence in development, production and global supply.

Radionuclide therapy represents an interesting (complementary) option to current treatment modalities because it permits the delivery of a high dose of therapeutic radiation to cancer cells while minimizing exposure of normal cells (143). Due to the fundamental linkage of the CXCR4/CXCL12 axis to cancer progression and metastasis, the CXCR4 receptor holds great potential for targeted radionuclide therapy. The specific activity of the peptide should be as high as possible to reach the maximal achievable absorbed dose in the tumor. Since radionuclide-conjugated peptides are administered in low mass amounts, unwanted side effects like the mobilization of stem cells in the case of CXCR4-targeting peptides are very unlikely to occur whereas ionizing irradiation is effectively delivered to the target. Before treatment, peptides can be radiolabeled with diagnostic radionuclides to identify receptor-positive tumor lesions, for treatment planning, and also dosimetry. Exchange to a therapeutic radionuclide, often by using the same peptide-conjugate, enables targeted radionuclide therapy. DOTATATE for instance has been labeled with different radionuclides for diagnosis (mainly 111In and 68Ga) and also treatment (mainly 177Lu and 90Y) of neuroendocrine tumors (144-146).  The decay properties of radionuclides, e.g. β- or α emission, emission energy, linear energy transfer (LET), and half-life are important characteristics for diagnosis and therapy and can be chosen individually, depending on the type of the tumor, its size, intratumoral distribution (i.e. degree of heterogeneity of radionuclide deposition), pharmacokinetics, and other factors. 177Lu for instance (β-, Emax 0.5 MeV, tissue rangemax 2 mm (144,147) is more appropriate for smaller tumors, while 90Y (β-, Emax 2.3 MeV, tissue rangemax 12 mm (144,147), may be beneficial for larger lesions with heterogeneous receptor expression (144,147,148). Compared to β-particles (LET: 0.1-1 keV/µm) and γ irradiation, the local density of ionizations along a track of α-particles is considerably higher because multiple ionizations  (60-230 keV/µm) occur in the immediate vicinity of the decay site (149). Hence, α-particle emitters can be beneficial to target single cancer cells, i.e. micro-metastases, which are difficult to treat by currently employed techniques (150). Moreover, the high specific ionization of α-emitters causes a higher fraction of double strand breaks and can break radio- and chemoresistance (151). Furthermore, cell death due to α-irradiation is minimally dependent on tumor oxygenation, which means that cells are killed effectively even in hypoxic areas of the tumor (152,153). Accordingly, the therapeutic potential of α-emitters like 211At, 213Bi, and 225Ac have been investigated in some early stage clinical trials (149,150,154).

Its application can have two di ﬀerent aims: imaging, with the visualization of a radioactive\nelement’s distribution in the body, or therapy, with speciﬁc irradiation of abnormal cells, thereby\nreducing damages to nearby healthy tissue. Having a broad range of potential biological targets and\ndesirable pharmacokinetic characteristics—such as high uptake in target tissue and fast blood and\nnon-target tissue clearance—peptides can also be easily chemically modiﬁed for incorporation into a\nradiopharmaceutical, making them a very potent targeting vector for nuclear medicine. Research in\nthat domain has thus gained widespread interest [ 46–49]. These compounds can be directly labeled\nwith a radionuclide, such as a halogen radioisotope, but they are generally based on a triple structure\ninvolving: (i) a radiometal, the radiation of which allows either the localization ( γandβ+emitters)\nor the destruction ( β−,αor Auger electron emitters) of the targeted cells; (ii) a bifunctional chelating\nagent (BFCA), the dual role of which is not only to bind the radiometal in a very stable manner to\nminimize its dissociation in vivo , but also to allow its conjugation with targeting moiety (or vector) via\na functionalized arm; (iii) a targeting moiety (the peptide analog), which aims to convey this set in a\nspeciﬁc way to a well-deﬁned target. To limit the inﬂuence of the chelating moiety, a linker (or spacer)\nis usually inserted between the BFCA and the biomolecule (Figure 4).\nThe choice of the radiometal is crucial, since it deeply inﬂuences the design of the chelating\nstructure [ 50–53]. Several criteria govern the choice of radionuclide: (i) the nature of the radiation\nemitted, depending on the intended application (diagnosis or therapy); (ii) the half-life, which must be\nlong enough to allow e ﬀective ﬁxation of the radiotracer on the target cells, but relatively short to avoid\nirradiation of the organism (neighboring healthy tissues) and more speciﬁcally non-targeted organs;\n(iii) the isotope decay proﬁle. By emitting its radiation, the nuclide disintegrates into a daughter nuclide,\nwhich must be non-radioactive to avoid any additional harmfulness to the organism; (iv) the means of\nproduction. Most of the radioelements used in nuclear medicine are artiﬁcial. They can be produced\nin three di ﬀerent ways: from a nuclear reactor, a cyclotron or via a generator.

- Iod-131 (131I): 131I wird in niedrigen Dosen für Diagnostik und Staging von Schilddrüsenkrebs mittels Gamma-Bildgebung und in hohen Dosen für die Schilddrüsenablationstherapie verwendet [Banerjee et al., 2015].

- Iod-123 (123I) und Iod-124 (124I): 123I eignet sich aufgrund der besseren Bildqualität und geringeren Strahlenbelastung besser für diagnostische Zwecke als 131I. 124I ist ein Positronenstrahler und wird daher in der PET verwendet [Gomes Marin et al., 2020].

The following iodine isotopes may be used as \ntheranostic agents (12,14):\n131I is a dual ( β- and γ-ray) emitting isotope with \na low cost and long half-life (~8 days) that is used \nfor therapy and whole-body diagnostic scanning to \nidentify remnant thyroid tissue or metastatic thy -\nroid cancer. However, it is not an ideal diagnostic \nagent owing to its γ-ray emission pattern and long \nhalf-life, which result in poor image quality and a \nrelatively high patient radiation dose.\n123I, a purely γ-ray emitter, has a more optimal \nphysical profile than 131I for diagnostic purposes \nin that it yields better image quality and involves \na lower radiation burden. Thus, this isotope is \nalso well suited for use in more recent approaches \nsuch as tomographic (SPECT) and hybrid imag-\ning in conjunction with CT (SPECT/CT). For \nthese reasons, despite its higher cost compared \nwith 131I, 123I is the most used iodine radioisotope \nfor diagnostic scintigraphy in the United States.\nIodine 124 (124I), a promising diagnostic agent, \nis a positron emitter and is therefore used in PET. \nIt is less frequently used clinically owing to its \neven higher production cost and lack of wide-\nspread availability.\nIn terms of therapeutic applications, radio-\niodine therapy with 131I remains the modality of \nchoice for treating patients with differentiated \nthyroid cancer in the postoperative setting. 131I \ntherapy can be performed by using different pro-\ntocols for different purposes, taking into account \nfactors such as initial extent of disease, surgical \nspecimen characteristics, histologic subtype, im-\naging findings, and biochemical changes, which ultimately determine the risk of disease recur-\nrence. The applications for 131I therapy, which \nmay be superimposed in the same patient, consist \nof ablation of residual normal tissue, adjuvant \ntreatment of occult disease, and treatment of \nknown local-regional or, especially, metastatic \ndisease. Posttreatment images can be acquired in \naddition to pretreatment images, which, owing to \nthe higher activity of 131I used in therapy, provide \nhigher sensitivity in the assessment of metastatic \nlesions and overall staging, particularly in cases \nof small metastatic lesions such as micronodular \nlung metastases (15). The example case in Figure \n5 illustrates the difference between pre- and post-\ntreatment images (15–17).\n131I-MIBG for Neural Crest–derived \nTumors\nRationale and Clinical Aspects.— The molecular \nanalog of norepinephrine, MIBG labeled with 131I \n(131I-MIBG), is another classic theranostic agent \nthat is suitable for gamma  camera and SPECT \nimaging, and it has been used in clinical settings \nsince 1981. 131I-MIBG enters the neuroendocrine \ncells of the sympathetic nervous system by means \nof endocytosis or diffusion and remains stored \nin neurosecretory vesicles. It has high sensitivity \n(>90%) and specificity (>95%) for the detec-\ntion of neural crest–derived (neuroectodermic) \ntumors and their secondary lesions (particularly \nin neuroblastoma, pheochromocytoma, and \nparaganglioma), complementing conventional \nimaging and indicating which tumors may benefit \nfrom radioisotopic therapy (12,18).\nLike radioiodine, 123I-MIBG facilitates better \nimaging and is suitable for SPECT and SPECT/\nCT, but at a higher cost. Recent improvements \nin SPECT/CT techniques include the use of 124I-\nMIBG for PET, which yields higher spatial reso-\nlution and accuracy.

The elution was monitored by detecting the radioac-\ntivity signal using a well-type NaI(Tl) detector (Jasco, Japan) \ncoupled with the HPLC system. All the solvents used for \nHPLC were degassed and filtered prior to use and were of \nHPLC grade. \nThe ‘theranostic potentials’ of 177Lu-EDTMP and 177Lu-\nDOTA-TATE were ascertained by administering the prepa-\nrations in patients suffering from metastatic bone pain due to \nprostate carcinoma and carcinomas of neuroendocrine ori-\ngins, respectively. In both the cases, the patients were ini-\ntially subjected to diagnostic evaluation by the administra-\ntion of the low dose preparation and subsequently the same \npatient was treated with high dose preparation of the same \nradiopharm aceutical. In addition, patients having skeletal \nmetastases have also undergone diagnostic imaging with \n99mTc-MDP. Similarly, neuroendocrine cancer patients have \nundergone add itional diagnostic scanning with either 99mTc-\nHYNIC-TOC or 68Ga-DOTA-TOC. \nThe ethical clearances for administration of the agents in \nhuman patients were obtained from the competent authorities \nof the respective nuclear medicine centers and written con-\nsents were taken from the patients prior to the administration \nof the agents. \nProduction of 177Lu \nLutetium-177 used for the present study, was produced in \nthe BARC (Bhabha Atomic Research Centre) ‘DHRUVA’ \nreactor by irradiating isotopically enriched Lu 2O3 target \n(82% in 176Lu) at a thermal neutron flux of ~1 \x021014 n.cm-2.s-1 \nfor a period of 21 days. The irradiated target was cooled for \n24 h and subsequently dissolved in 0.01 M supra-pure HCl \nby gentle warming. The resulting solution was evaporated to \nnear-dryness and reconstituted with supra-pure water. The \nevaporation and volume reconstitution steps were repeated \ntwo to three times. Finally the radioactive solution was \npassed through the Millipore\x01 (0.22 \x01) filter paper. 177LuCl 3, \nthus obtained, was directly used for the formulation of \npatient doses of 177Lu-EDTMP and 177Lu-DOTA-TATE as \nwell as for the preparation of 177Lu-labeled HA particles. \nThe total 177Lu radioactivity produced and its radio-\nnuclidic purity were determined following the procedure \nmentioned in the literature [6, 13].', 'Molecules 2020 ,25, 4012 16 of 35\n3.2. Radiolabeled Somatostatin Analogs for Therapy\nConcerning radionuclide therapy and more particularly peptide receptor radionuclide therapy\n(PRRT), radioactivity is used to destroy the targeted cells. Radiopharmaceuticals used in therapy are\ndesigned in the same way as those used in imaging, only the nature of the radioelement being modiﬁed.\nContrary to imaging, which uses radioelements having very penetrating but little ionizing radiations,\nPRRT privileges the use of radionuclides that have little penetrating and more energetic and thus more\nionizing radiations. Brought directly to the cancer cell, the radiation emitted by the radioactive decay\ncauses irreversible ionization of the cell’s DNA, which induces its apoptosis. The main isotopes used\ntoday are iodine-131, yttrium-90, lutetium-177 and, to a lesser extent, rhenium-188 [ 158]. As mentioned\nearlier, the purpose of the DOTA-SSA design was to work with a chelating cavity capable of complexing\nradioelements for imaging or therapy. Consequently, most of the platforms discussed above have been\ntransposed for therapeutic application via the use of β−emitters [64,74,81,82].\n3.2.1. Yttrium-90 and Lutetium-177\nYttrium-90, a pure high energy β−emitter (T 1/2=64 h, E βmax=2.28 MeV), and lutetium-177,\na medium energy β−emitter (T 1/2=6.7 d, E βmax=0.5 MeV) with a γcomponent (208 keV), are\ncurrently the most used in PRRT. Each of these two elements has its own advantages for targeted\ntherapy. The particles emitted by90Y are more energetic and more penetrating; they are able to di ﬀuse\non a thicker layer of cells, which is an advantage for the treatment of large tumors. However, even if\nhigh energy radiation allows a more uniform irradiation of the tumor, the risk of imposing an excessive\ndose of radiation on the adjacent tissues is very present. For its part, the177Lu emits less energetic\nradiation, more suited to small tumors. In addition, the energy of its γradiation is su ﬃcient to allow\ndetection by scintigraphy and establish dosimetry during the therapy sequences [159].\nThe ﬁrst analog to be studied was [90Y]-DOTATOC (Octreother®), and the ﬁrst treatment sessions\nquickly showed good results, stopping the progression of the tumor [ 72,160,161]. Many studies on this\nlong-used treatment have made it possible to observe a good tolerance for this radiotracer, with fairly\nmild side e ﬀects (fatigue) and in very rare cases a little more severe ones (nausea). However, it also\nshowed some toxicity for the kidneys and the bones, these two aspects being the dose-limiting factors\nfor the patient. In vitro , a greater a ﬃnity for SSTR2 has been demonstrated for [90Y]-DOTATATE\ncompared to [90Y]-DOTATOC [ 64]. However, for the diagnosis in humans, a better contrast between\nthe kidneys and the tumor was found for [111In]-DOTATOC compared to [111In]-DOTATATE [ 73],\nwhich may explain the wider use of DOTATOC analog. Despite this, these two analogs have relatively\nsimilar properties and have proven to be e ﬀective treatment methods that improve survival in some\npatients with neuroendocrine tumors (approximately 50 months vs. 18 months without treatment) [ 162].\nIn a Phase IIA study with [90Y]-DOTALAN (MAURITIUS trial), this one demonstrated lower tumor\nuptake in neuroendocrine tumors compared to90Y-DOTATOC, but could be of potential interest for\nother tumors, such as HCC or lung cancers [ 163]. With the perspective of several years of clinical use,\nPRRT with90Y-labeled somatostatin analogs appears to be well-tolerated with favorable long-term\noutcome.', '20 On a large scale, only a few radionuclide therapies are routinely used. 131I for instance is relatively inexpensive and can be used for imaging and therapy. In radioimmunotherapy, the β-particle emitting isotopes 131I and 90Y have been employed in >95% of clinical radioimmunotherapy trials (155,156). Proteins labeled with 131I however, degrade quickly when endocytosed in tumor cells and result in the release of 131I-tyrosine and free 131I into the blood stream (157). In general the use of 131I in PRRT has not been particularly successful. Bakker et al. for instance reported on the extensive radiolytic decomposition of octreotide for therapeutic doses of 131I-labeled octreotide for therapy of neuroendocrine tumors (158). Clinical trials of 177Lu and 67Cu (159-161) as well as current and clinical prospects of therapeutic radionuclides in nuclear medicine can be found in the literature (162-164).  Regarding CXCR4, various CXCR4 antagonists have been developed and some are investigated as anticancer agents (165). The majority of these agents aim towards blocking the CXCR4 receptor, hence interfering in cell migration processes and positively affecting overall survival. Nevertheless, the effect on tumor growth by antagonizing CXCR4 alone has only a negligible effect and is more efficient with combined chemotherapy. Throughout the thesis, several new pentixafor-based imaging agents for CXCR4 were developed. Selected structural modifications of the pentixafor scaffold lead to pentixather (cyclo(-D-Tyr(3-I)-N-Me-D-Orn(AMB, DOTA)-L-Arg-L-2-Nal-Gly-)), which provides a molecular scaffold with higher flexibility towards structural modifications (166,167). Pentixather labeled with potential nuclides for endoradiotherapy (e.g. 90Y, 177Lu, 213Bi) showed high receptor affinities  (chapter III.6 and appendix) and [90Y/177Lu]pentixather already demonstrated promising results in patients with multiple myeloma (167).

Targeted \nradiopharmaceuticals are created by linking a therapeutic radioisotope to a targeting molecule (e.g., peptide, antibo dy, small molecule) that can precisely recognize tumor cells and bind to tumor -specific \ncharacteristics, like receptors on the tumor cell surface . As a result, the radioisotope accumulates at \nthe tumor site and decays, releasing a small amount of ionizing radiation, thereby destroying tumor  \ntissue . The highly precise localization enables targeted treatment with minimal impact to healthy \nsurrounding tissue.  \n \nAbout ITM -11 (n.c.a. \n177Lu-edotreotide ) \nITM-11, ITM’s therapeutic  radiopharmaceutical  candidate  being  investigated in the phase III clinical \nstudies COMPETE and COMPOSE,  consists of two components: the medical radioisotope no -carrier -\nadded lutetium -177 (n.c.a. 177Lu) and the targeting molecule e dotreotide, a synthetic form of the \npeptide hormone somatostatin that targets neuroendocrine tumor -specific receptors.  Edotreotide \nbinds to these receptors and places the medical radioisotope n.c.a. l utetium -177 directly onto the \ndiseased neuroendocrine cells so that it accumulates at the tumor site. N.c.a.  lutetium -177 is \ninternalized into the tumor cells and decays, releasing medical radiation (ionizing β -radiation) with a \nmaximum radius of 1.7 mm and destroying tumor  tissue . The highly precise localization can result in \nthe healthy tissue surrounding the targeted tumor being minimally affected.  \n ITM Isotope Technologie s Munich SE  \nITM, a radiopharmaceutical biotech company, is dedicated to providing the most precise cancer \nradiotherapeutics and diagnostics to meet the needs of patients, clinicians and our partners through \nexcellence in development, production and global supply.

33G advanced RAG,Wie funktioniert PRRT/Wie ist das Medikament zusammengesetzt?,german,general,mechanism of action,claude-3-opus-20240229 advanced RAG,"PRRT funktioniert folgendermaßen:

Das Medikament besteht aus drei Hauptbestandteilen: einem radioaktiven Isotop (meist Lutetium-177), einem Liganden oder Trägermolekül (Octreotid oder Octreotate) und einem Chelator (DOTA), der diese beiden Komponenten verbindet und den Komplex stabilisiert [1].

Nach intravenöser Gabe bindet das Medikament an Somatostatin-Rezeptoren (v.a. Subtyp 2), die auf der Oberfläche der Tumorzellen überexprimiert sind. Der Radiopharmaka-Rezeptor-Komplex wird dann in die Zelle aufgenommen (internalisiert). Die Betastrahlung des Lutetium-177 führt zu DNA-Schäden wie Einzel- und Doppelstrangbrüchen und letztlich zum Zelltod [2].

Die Gammastrahlung des Lutetium-177 ermöglicht zudem eine Bildgebung und Dosimetrie. Octreotate hat im Vergleich zu Octreotid eine höhere Affinität zum Somatostatin-Rezeptor Subtyp 2, was zu einer 3-4 fach höheren Aufnahme in den Tumor führt [2].","['If GEP-NETS are resectable, surgery is the primary ap-\nproach. Patients with unresectable metastatic disease usually\ngo through multiple lines of treatments including somatostatin\nanalogue (SSA) therapy or targeted therapy, such as everoli-mus (mTOR inhibitor) or sunitinib (tyrosine kinase inhibitor)\n[7]. In patients with grade 1 and 2 NETs (Ki-7 LI of up to\n20%) that are inoperable and metastatic, who have failed first-\nline somatostatin treatment, and whose tumors express high\nlevels of somatostatin receptors (SSTRs), peptide receptor ra-\ndionuclide therapy (PRRT) would be a viable option. PRRTusually involves DOTATOC, DOTATATE, and DOTANOC\nlabeled either with\n90Yor177Lu [7]. Patients included in study\nprotocols have positive NET histology and SSTR scintigraphy\nwith111In OctreoScan or68Ga PET-Dota-peptide (Fig. 1). A\npositive scan denotes lesion uptake that is equal to or greaterthan the liver uptake [ 8]. Important criteria to be taken into\naccount when considering PRRT include objective disease\nprogression, adequate blood profile (hemoglobin, white cell,\nand platelet count levels), creatinine, and ECOG performancescore ≤2[8]. A good performance status means the patient\nwould be self-sufficient and reduces the need for physicalassistance during the treatment period (3 days/cycle).Recently published European Society for Medical Oncology\n(ESMO) Clinical Practice Guidelines have recommended\nPRRT up to the upper limit of Ki-67 LI to 30% [ 9].\nScintigraphic or PET tomoscintigraphic evaluation is to datethe most accurate noninvasive method to identify and confirmthe overexpression of functioning receptors [ 10]. An impor-\ntant issue in the consideration of PRRT is that the somatostatinreceptors should be functional, i.e., able to internalize the re-ceptor analogue complex and retain the radioactivity inside\nthe cell. The critical issues for effective therapy are somato-\nstatin receptor overexpression and the evidence of functional-ity. The nuclear physician can calculate a tumor-to-liver ratio\nas a relative measure of receptor number [ 11]; this ratio must\nbe high for PRRT eligibility.Mechanism of Action and Constituents\nof Radiolabeled SSAs\nSomatostatin ’s actions include inhibiting hormone secretion,\nsuppressing the release of insulin-like growth factors,\ninhibiting angiogenesis, and inducing apoptosis in the tumor\ntissue [ 12]. Such biologic effects are mediated through inter-\naction with five subtypes of somatostatin receptors (SSTR1-\n5), which belong to the seven-transmembrane domain, G-\nprotein-coupled receptor superfamily. The currently approvedSSAs are octreotide and lanreotide, in slow-release formula-\ntions, long-acting release (LAR), and supersaturated solution\n(Autogel®).\nDue to the overexpression of SSTRs in NETs, which is\nestimated to be in around 80% of NETs, they are consideredsuitable targets for PRRT with radiolabeled SSA. Once boundto their receptor, radiolabeled SSAs are internalized as per\nnormal receptor recycling dynamics, and the breakdown prod-\nucts of the radiolabeled peptides are stored in lysosomes, thusenabling delivery and causing suspension of radioactivity in-\nside the tumor cell [ 13]. This would result in radiation-induced\nDNA damage of the tumor cell and its eventual death.\nRadiolabeled SSAs are made up of three main constituents;\na radionuclide isotope, a ligand or carrier molecule (TOC or\nTATE), and a chelator or linker (DOTA) that binds them to-\ngether and stabilizes the complex (Fig. 2). Chelators mainly\nused include DOTA (tetraazacyclododecane tetra-acetic acid)\nand DTPA (diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid), while\noctreotide and octreotate (TOC and TATE, respectively) are\ngenerally used as ligands [ 14].

33E advanced RAG,How does PRRT work/what is the drug made up of?,english,general,mechanism of action,claude-3-opus-20240229 advanced RAG,"According to the provided context, peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) works by targeting somatostatin receptors (SSTRs) that are overexpressed on neuroendocrine tumor (NET) cells [1,2,3]. The radiolabeled somatostatin analogues used in PRRT consist of three main components [1,2]:

1. A radionuclide isotope, such as 90Y or 177Lu, which emits beta particles for therapeutic effect.
2. A ligand or carrier molecule derived from octreotide (TOC or TATE) that binds to the SSTR.  
3. A chelator or linker, such as DOTA (tetraazacyclododecane tetra-acetic acid), that binds the radionuclide and ligand together and stabilizes the complex.

After binding to SSTR2 on the tumor cell surface, the radiopharmaceutical-receptor complex is internalized. The radiation then induces DNA damage, particularly double-strand breaks, leading to tumor cell death [2].","['If GEP-NETS are resectable, surgery is the primary ap-\nproach.

Treatment of NET patients with PRRT requires dedicated clinical ex-\npertis e due to the biological characteristics of PRRT (for example , binding to SSTR, DNA \ndamage induction capacity and the radioactive component) and specific characteristics of \nNET patients (such as origin, grade and SSTR expression). Consequently, eligibility of \nNET patients for PRRT should be discussed in an expert multidisciplinary team. This re-view provides an overview of the development of PRRT, clinical management of patients \nundergoing PRRT and key unmet needs for future investigations.  \n2. Background of PRRT  \n2.1. Mechanism of Action  \nPRRT with \n177Lu-DOTATATE uses an intravenously administered beta radiation -\nemitting radiopharmaceutical targeting SSTR on tumor cells. SSTRs are G -protein coupled \nreceptors with five subtypes of which subtype 2 ( SSTR 2) is the most commonly expressed \nin NETs, followed by SSTR 1 and SSTR 5 [5,6] . Healthy non- diseased organs can also express \nSSTR subtypes, as can be seen in the healthy liver, spleen, pituitary, salivary glands, thy-\nroid, adrenals, kidney, prostate, panc reas, intestine and blood vessels [7 –9]. The anti-\ntumoral effect of PRRT is triggered by radiation -induced DNA damage. After binding to \nthe SSTR 2, the radiopharmaceutical agonists are internalized into the tumor cell where the \nirradiation induces dif ferent types of DNA damage such as DNA single strand breaks \n(SSBs) and DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) of which the latter are the major contribu-\ntors to tumor cell death induction [10,11]  (Figure 1 ). \n \nFigure 1. Mechanism of action of PRRT with 177Lu-DOTATATE. Intravenous administration of 177Lu-\nDOTATATE leads to tumor cell binding via SSTR 2. After internalization of the radiopharmaceuti-\ncal–SSTR 2 complex , local radiation by beta particles can lead to cell death th rough the induction of \nDNA damage (image created with BioRender.com , accessed on  1 September  2022 ). \n2.2. The Choice for 177Lu-DOTATATE \nClinical development of PRRT commenced with SSAs labeled with indium -111, yt-\ntrium -90 and lutetium -177 [12].', 'J. Clin. Med. 2021 ,10, 1267 2 of 15\n(SSTR). For many years, evidence of an anti-tumor effect of PRRT were only obtained from\nnon-randomized Phase II trials or retrospective studies. The NETTER-1 Phase III Random-\nized Trial finally validated this treatment option by confirming its low toxicity but also its\neffectiveness in tumor control. Following these results,177Lu-DOTATATE was approved by\nthe US Food and Drug Administration in 2018 and the European Medicines Agency in 2017\nfor the treatment of gastroenteropancreatic NETs that are well differentiated and obtain a\nprescription authorization in France in metastatic midgut NETs [ 2]. Some interesting data\nexist for pancreatic and pulmonary NETs. In this review, we discuss the clinical efficiency of\nPRRT in gastroenteropancreatic and pulmonary NETs.\n2. Somatostatin Receptors (SSTR) and Radio-Labelled Somatostatin Analogues\nEffect of PRRT is correlated with the ability for the markers to ﬁx the SSTR (SSTR1-5).\nThis therapy is therefore dedicated to NETs who strongly over expressed those receptors.\nSSTRs belong to a family of G-protein coupled receptors with seven transmembrane\ndomains. The majority of well differentiated gastroenteropancreatic and pulmonary NETs\nare characterized by the strong expression of SSTR, including SSTR2 Grade 1/2 NETs\nexpress the SSTR more often and at higher levels than grade 3 NETs. When linked to the\nreceptors, radiolabeled somatostatin analogues are internalized according to the normal\nrecycling dynamics of membrane receptors and the degradation products of peptides\nare stored in lysosomes, in intracellular, which allows for the release and retention of\nradioactivity inside tumor cells [ 3]. This mechanism accounts for the low toxicity of the\nPRRT on the healthy cells. Radiolabelled somatostatin analogs are made up of an isotope\nradionuclide, a carrier molecule (derived from octreotide), and a chelating agent that binds\nthem together and stabilizes the complex. The commonly used chelating agents are DOTA\n(DOTA acid and tetra-azacyclododecane-tetra-acetic) and DTPA (di-ethylenetriamine penta-\naceticacid). Three radionucleides (111In,90Y and177Lu) were conjugated to the somatostatin\nanalogues and their different physical characteristics confer speciﬁc advantages. The90Y\nand177Lu emit beta particles with higher energy and longer ranges, which translates into\ngreater therapeutic potential. Due to the emission of gamma rays, the177Lu can also be\nused for dosimetry and monitoring of tumor response [4].\n3. Modalities of Realization and Patients Selection\nPRRT is the single validated treatment option in the NETs, which for there is a pre-\ndictive marker of answer: the expression of SSTR. Response rates have been shown to\nbe increased in patients with a higher degree of absorption of radiotracers in the case of\n111In-pentetreotid scintigraphy An overall response rate of approximately 60% has been\nreported in patients with a grade 4 according to the Krenning score, corresponding to a tu-\nmor absorption greater than that of the spleen, and kidneys. Intense ﬁxation (SUV) greater\nthan 16 on the68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT is a predictive marker of high tumor response\n(sensitivity: 95%; specﬁcity: 60 %) [ 5] (Figure 1). The effectiveness of PRRT is correlated\nwith the tumor volume and the location of the primary tumor (amount of SSTR present\non the tumor cell) (Figure 2). Thus, NETs with high liver tumor volume are considered\nto be less sensitive to PRRT [ 6]. Similarly, it is suggested that pancreatic NETs frequently\nrespond to the PRRT but with an earlier progression than in midgut NETs. The treatment\nmodalities are relatively standardized in France with a treatment carried out by infusion\nof radiolabel split in four cycles spaced eight weeks apart.']",4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,122

Dies wird durch funktionelle Ganzkörperbildgebung mit 111In-Pentetreotid (OctreoScan) oder 68Ga-DOTA-Peptid PET/CT oder durch Immunhistochemie bestimmt [1].,"['however, still used by some in the USA mainly due to the lack\nof availability of β-emitting radiotracers. High-energy βemit-\nters, such as90Y with a longer βrange in soft tissue, were\nconsidered more promising for the treatment of bulky tumour.\nA novel analogue, Tyr3-octreotide, with a similar affinity\nprofile for sstrs, was developed. Linked to a macrocyclicchelator (DOTA), it allows simple and stable radiolabelling\nof\n111In and90Y to [DOTA0,Tyr3]-octreotide (90Y-DOTA-\nTOC) [ 44]. PRRNT using90Y-DOTATOC was first used in\n1996 in a patient in Basel, Switzerland. The excellent subjec-\ntive and objective response following several cycles of90Y-\nDOTATOC led to high expectations as to the therapeuticpotential of PRRNT in patients with NET. Since then other\ncentres worldwide have conducted clinical trials with\n90Y-\nDOTATOC [ 45]. Since the year 2000, octreotate (Tyr3,Thr8-\noctreotide), a newer analogue with improved affinity for sstr2,\nhas been synthesized. The chelated analogue [DOTA0,Tyr3]-\noctreotate (DOTATATE) can be labelled with the β-a n d γ-\nemitting isotope177Lu and has been used in clinical studies.\nIndications and contraindications\nIndications\nPRRNT is indicated for the treatment of patients with\npositive expression of sstr2, or metastatic or inoperable\nNET [ 46–50]. Candidate patients for PRRNT using\nradiolabelled somatostatin analogues are mainly those\nwith sstr2-expressing NET of the gastroenteropancreatic\nand bronchial tracts, but may also include patients withphaeochromocytoma, paraganglioma, neuroblastoma [ 51]\nor medullary thyroid carcinoma [ 52–56]. The ideal can-\ndidates for PRRNT are those w ith well-differentiated\nand moderately differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas\ndefined as NET grade 1 or 2 according to the recent\nWHO 2010 classification [ 4].\nContraindications\nAbsolute\n&Pregnancy.\n&Severe acute concomitant illnesses.\n&Severe unmanageable psychiatric disorder.\nRelative\n&Breast feeding (if not discontinued).\n&Severely compromised renal function: for PRRNT with\na\n90Y-labelled peptide age-adjusted normal renal func-\ntion is essential.

For177Lu-labelled peptide a mild to moderate\ngrade of renal impairment can be tolerated (e.g. creati-\nnine ≤1.7 mg/dl). Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and\ntubular extraction rate (TER) should be at least 60 % of\nmean age-adjusted normal values.\n&Severely compromised bone marrow: noncompromised\nhaematological reserve should be present before\nPRRNT.

Side effects involving the\nkidney and the bone marrow are mild if adequate renalprotection and fractionation are used. Renal function\nshould be assessed by means of laboratory tests (creat-\ninine and BUN), or calculation of creatinine clearance(e.g. Cockroft-Gault formula ). Additional studies, e.g.\nmeasurement of GFR with 24-h urine collection or\nnuclear medicine methods (e.g.\n99mTc-MAG3 with\nTER determination,99mTc-DTPA GFR or effective renal\nplasma flow using hippuran), should be performed in\npatients with risk factors for renal toxicity or withcompromised renal function, and in all children.', 'If GEP-NETS are resectable, surgery is the primary ap-\nproach. Patients with unresectable metastatic disease usually\ngo through multiple lines of treatments including somatostatin\nanalogue (SSA) therapy or targeted therapy, such as everoli-mus (mTOR inhibitor) or sunitinib (tyrosine kinase inhibitor)\n[7]. In patients with grade 1 and 2 NETs (Ki-7 LI of up to\n20%) that are inoperable and metastatic, who have failed first-\nline somatostatin treatment, and whose tumors express high\nlevels of somatostatin receptors (SSTRs), peptide receptor ra-\ndionuclide therapy (PRRT) would be a viable option. PRRTusually involves DOTATOC, DOTATATE, and DOTANOC\nlabeled either with\n90Yor177Lu [7]. Patients included in study\nprotocols have positive NET histology and SSTR scintigraphy\nwith111In OctreoScan or68Ga PET-Dota-peptide (Fig. 1). A\npositive scan denotes lesion uptake that is equal to or greaterthan the liver uptake [ 8]. Important criteria to be taken into\naccount when considering PRRT include objective disease\nprogression, adequate blood profile (hemoglobin, white cell,\nand platelet count levels), creatinine, and ECOG performancescore ≤2[8]. A good performance status means the patient\nwould be self-sufficient and reduces the need for physicalassistance during the treatment period (3 days/cycle).Recently published European Society for Medical Oncology\n(ESMO) Clinical Practice Guidelines have recommended\nPRRT up to the upper limit of Ki-67 LI to 30% [ 9].\nScintigraphic or PET tomoscintigraphic evaluation is to datethe most accurate noninvasive method to identify and confirmthe overexpression of functioning receptors [ 10]. An impor-\ntant issue in the consideration of PRRT is that the somatostatinreceptors should be functional, i.e., able to internalize the re-ceptor analogue complex and retain the radioactivity inside\nthe cell. The critical issues for effective therapy are somato-\nstatin receptor overexpression and the evidence of functional-ity. The nuclear physician can calculate a tumor-to-liver ratio\nas a relative measure of receptor number [ 11]; this ratio must\nbe high for PRRT eligibility.Mechanism of Action and Constituents\nof Radiolabeled SSAs\nSomatostatin ’s actions include inhibiting hormone secretion,\nsuppressing the release of insulin-like growth factors,\ninhibiting angiogenesis, and inducing apoptosis in the tumor\ntissue [ 12]. Such biologic effects are mediated through inter-\naction with five subtypes of somatostatin receptors (SSTR1-\n5), which belong to the seven-transmembrane domain, G-\nprotein-coupled receptor superfamily. The currently approvedSSAs are octreotide and lanreotide, in slow-release formula-\ntions, long-acting release (LAR), and supersaturated solution\n(Autogel®).\nDue to the overexpression of SSTRs in NETs, which is\nestimated to be in around 80% of NETs, they are consideredsuitable targets for PRRT with radiolabeled SSA. Once boundto their receptor, radiolabeled SSAs are internalized as per\nnormal receptor recycling dynamics, and the breakdown prod-\nucts of the radiolabeled peptides are stored in lysosomes, thusenabling delivery and causing suspension of radioactivity in-\nside the tumor cell [ 13]. This would result in radiation-induced\nDNA damage of the tumor cell and its eventual death.\nRadiolabeled SSAs are made up of three main constituents;\na radionuclide isotope, a ligand or carrier molecule (TOC or\nTATE), and a chelator or linker (DOTA) that binds them to-\ngether and stabilizes the complex (Fig. 2). Chelators mainly\nused include DOTA (tetraazacyclododecane tetra-acetic acid)\nand DTPA (diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid), while\noctreotide and octreotate (TOC and TATE, respectively) are\ngenerally used as ligands [ 14]. The most known and studied\nSSA is octreotide.', '&A patient with pending liver failure should be consid-\nered with caution before being submitted to PRRNT.\nProcedure\nPretherapy assessment\nThe availability of the following information is mandatory\nwhen considering a patient for PRRNT:\n&NET proven by histopathology (immunohistochemistry).\n&High sstr expression determined by functional whole-\nbody imaging with111In-pentetreotide (OctreoScan) or68\nGa-DOTA-peptide PET/CT or immunohistochemistry.\nThe following criteria should be taken into consideration\nwhen deciding whether or not to perform PRRNT.\n&Karnofsky/Lansky performance status above 60 % or\nECOG performance status less than 2.\n&Tumour differentiation, preferably grade 1/2.\n&Tumour proliferation rate, preferably with a Ki-67/mitotic\nindex ≤20 %. In addition, the rate of tumour growth, as\ndetermined by CTor MRI, could be considered. Note that,in general, less-differentiated tumours showing high pro-\nliferation rates are better candidates for chemotherapy.\nFacility and personnel\nPRRNT is still considered an investigational treatment and\nits implementation must comply with national legislation\nand local requirements, as well as with ethical principles\nregarding human studies. The decision to provide PRRNTshould be taken within a multidisciplinary tumour board,\nincluding all the specialists involved in the care of patients\nwith NET. The facility requirements will depend on nationallegislation on the therapeutic use of radioactive agents. If\ninpatient therapy is required by national legislation, the\ntreatment should take place in an approved facility. Thefacility must have appropriate personnel, radiation safety\nequipment, and procedures for waste management and han-\ndling accidental contamination of the site or personnel.\n90Y-DOTATOC or177Lu-DOTATATE should be admin-\nistered by appropriately trained medical staff with support-\ning nursing staff with a medical physics expert available.\nPhysicians responsible for treating patients should have a\ngeneral knowledge of the pathophysiology and natural historyof the respective diseases, should be familiar with alternative\nforms of therapy, and should be able to closely liaise with\nother physicians involved in managing the patients. Cliniciansinvolved in the utilization of unsealed radionuclide sources for\ntherapy must also be knowledgeable about and compliant with\napplicable national legislation and local regulations.Patient preparation\nRenal protectionTogether with the bone marrow, the kidneys are the critical\norgans in PRRNT particularly when using\n90Y-DOTATOC.\nProximal tubular reabsorption of the radiopeptide and subse-\nquent retention in the interstitium result in excessive renal\nirradiation. Nephrotoxicity may be aggravated by risk factors,such as preexisting hypertension or diabetes mellitus [ 57]. To\ncounteract and reduce the high kidney retention of radiopep-\ntides, positively charged amino acids, such as\nL-lysine and/or\nL-arginine, are coinfused to competitively inhibit the proximal\ntubular reabsorption of the radiopeptide. The coadministration\nof these amino acids leads to a significant reduction in the\nrenal absorbed dose, which ranges from 9 % to 53 % [ 58].\nRenal absorbed dose is further reduced by up to 39 % byextending the infusion time of the amino acid solution over\n10 h, and up to 65 % by extending the protection over 2 days\nfollowing radiopeptide administration, thereby covering therenal elimination phase more efficiently [ 59,60].\nAmino acid protection protocols\nLysine and/or arginine should be diluted appropriately in\nlarge volumes of normal saline in order to hydrate thepatient, unless the patient suffers from cardiac insufficiency\n(e.g. carcinoid heart valve disease), in which case volume\noverload, possibly leading to acute exacerbation of the con-dition, should be avoided. Hyperosmotic solutions in partic-\nular should be avoided since they can induce dangerous\nelectrolyte imbalances that might lead to severe metabolicacidosis and cardiac arrhythmias. An appropriate dilution is\n25 g of amino acid in 1 l of normal saline.\nBefore beginning the amino acid infusion, appropriate\nmeasures against nausea and vomiting should be undertaken\nby administering an antiemetic (e.g. 5-HT3 antagonist, such as\ngranisetron) and/or a corticosteroid (e.g.']",4.0,0.6666666666666666,1.0,1.0,0,1.0,1.0,1.0,38

Since PRRT\ncan induce toxicity, the following pre-treatment laboratory values are required: creatinine\nclearance > 40 mL/min, hemoglobin levels ≥6 mmol/L, leukocytes > 2 ×109/L, platelet\ncount > 75 ×109/L, bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) and aspartate aminotrans-\nferase (ASAT) < 3 times the upper limit of normal and albumin > 3 g/dL [2,3].\n8. PRRT-Related Toxicity\nAdverse events related to PRRT are frequently mild and include nausea, abdominal pain\nand asthenia [ 27,50]. Increased hair loss is observed in up to 60% of patients treated with\n177Lu-DOTATATE, but this is temporary and seldom leads to baldness [ 88]. Besides these\nmild adverse events, PRRT can induce more severe toxicities which can be dose-limiting and\nadjustments to the treatment schedule might be required [ 89].

Theranostics is essentially the fusion of two words, therapy and diagnostics, and involves combining diagnostic and therapeutic modalities for a given disease based on targeting the same molecular pathways.","['NUCLEAR MEDICINE 1715\nTheranostics in Nuclear Medicine: \nEmerging and Re-emerging Inte -\ngrated Imaging and Therapies in \nthe Era of Precision Oncology\nTheranostics refers to the pairing of diagnostic biomarkers with \ntherapeutic agents that share a specific target in diseased cells or \ntissues. Nuclear medicine, particularly with regard to applications \nin oncology, is currently one of the greatest components of the \ntheranostic concept in clinical and research scenarios. Theranostics \nin nuclear medicine, or nuclear theranostics, refers to the use of \nradioactive compounds to image biologic phenomena by means of \nexpression of specific disease targets such as cell surface receptors \nor membrane transporters, and then to use specifically designed \nagents to deliver ionizing radiation to the tissues that express these \ntargets. The nuclear theranostic approach has sparked increasing \ninterest and gained importance in parallel to the growth in molecu -\nlar imaging and personalized medicine, helping to provide custom -\nized management for various diseases; improving patient selection, \nprediction of response and toxicity, and determination of prognosis; \nand avoiding futile and costly diagnostic examinations and treat -\nment of many diseases. The authors provide an overview of ther -\nanostic approaches in nuclear medicine, starting with a review of \nthe main concepts and unique features of nuclear theranostics and \naided by a retrospective discussion of the progress of theranostic \nagents since early applications, with illustrative cases emphasizing \nthe imaging features. Advanced concepts regarding the role of fluo -\nrine 18–fluorodeoxyglucose PET in theranostics, as well as develop -\nments in and future directions of theranostics, are discussed.\n©RSNA, 2020 • radiographics.rsna.orgJosé Flávio Gomes Marin, MD  \nRafael F .
