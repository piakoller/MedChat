1G advanced RAG,Was ist der Stellenwert von PRRT innerhalb GEP-NET?,german,general,therapy,gpt-4o advanced RAG,"Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT) hat sich als eine vielversprechende Behandlungsoption für Patienten mit G1 und G2 gastroenteropankreatischen neuroendokrinen Tumoren (GEP-NETs) etabliert. Studien haben gezeigt, dass PRRT eine vergleichbare oder sogar überlegene progressionsfreie Überlebensrate (PFS) im Vergleich zu anderen Behandlungsmethoden aufweist (Rogoza et al., 2022, S. 15). Insbesondere das NETTER-1 Phase-III-Studie hat gezeigt, dass 177Lu-DOTATATE PRRT nicht nur das progressionsfreie Überleben verbessert, sondern auch die Lebensqualität der Patienten signifikant erhöht im Vergleich zu hochdosiertem Octreotid (Rogoza et al., 2022, S. 15). PRRT wird als Drittlinientherapie für Patienten mit fortgeschrittenen, lokal fortgeschrittenen GEP-NETs empfohlen, insbesondere nach dem Versagen von Somatostatin-Analoga (SSAs), Everolimus und/oder zytotoxischer Chemotherapie (Rogoza et al., 2022, S. 15).","['Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2022 ,23, 1447 15 of 22\nstudies examining the feasibility, outcome, and safety of PRRT also demonstrated a PFS\ncomparable to, and in some cases superior to, that of other treatment modalities. Due to\nthe retrospective nature of these studies, the results required conﬁrmation in prospective\ntrials. According to PanNET guidelines, PRRT should even be used as a third-line therapy\nin patients with advanced locoregional disease following the failure of SSAs, everolimus,\nand/or cytotoxic chemotherapy [ 8]. Two cases were presented for third-line therapy, in\nwhich patients with metastatic PanNET (G2 Ki-67 10%) received chemotherapy or PRRT\naccording to the standard of care following SSA failure. After six cycles of STZ/5-FU (over\nnine months), the patient progressed four months later without treatment. The majority of\nparticipants preferred PRRT (38.6%, n = 32) over STZ/5-FU reinduction (26.5%, n = 22) [ 136].\nIn patients with GEP-NET G1 and G2, 177Lu-PRRT was compared to the mTOR inhibitor\neverolimus. Despite the success of 177Lu-DOTATATE PRRT, not all patients showed bene-\nﬁts, and patients typically relapsed 2–3 years after initiating treatment. As a result, various\nexperimental approaches and strategies are being investigated in order to maximize PRRT’s\neffectiveness while minimizing potential side effects [ 8]. The NETTER-1 phase III study\ndemonstrated that, in addition to improving progression-free survival, 177Lu-Dotatate\nsigniﬁcantly improves patient quality of life signiﬁcantly when compared to high-dose\noctreotide [ 137]. In the study where 229 patients randomly received Lu-DOTATATE every\neight weeks for four cycles plus 30 mg octreotide every four weeks or high-dose octreotide\n(60 mg) every four weeks alone showed a signiﬁcant reduction in tumour progression or\ndeath in the Lu-DOTATATE treatment group. According to recent investigations, the time\nto quality of life decline was substantially longer in the 177Lu-DOTATATE therapy group.\nAfter the NETTER-1 phase III trial, the 177Lu-DOTATATE treatment was approved for\nthe somatostatin receptor-positive GEP-NETs [ 138]. To begin, treatment may be continued\nafter four cycles of PRRT, depending on kidney and bone marrow tolerance, for example,\nwith a reduced radioactivity as part of the salvage therapy (Re-PRRT). Retreatment with\n177Lu-DOTATATE-based PRRT showed an optimistic survival beneﬁt with acceptable\nsafety in patients with NETs [ 139]. The administration of PRRT intra-arterially into the\nhepatic artery rather than intravenously may increase the tumour-absorbed dose in liver\nmetastases. However, intra-arterial administration is not mentioned in guidelines and is\nconsidered experimental [ 140]. Patients with hepatic dominant metastases, in particular,\nwould beneﬁt from this approach due to the increased uptake of the radiopharmaceutical\n(the so-called “ﬁrst-pass” effect). In a neoadjuvant setting, the PRRT is becoming increas-\ningly important. PRRT was associated with a signiﬁcant reduction in tumour size and the\ntumour was rendered operable in patients with inoperable PanNETs and distant (metastatic)\ndisease. In such instances, a complete response was possible [ 8]. PRRT was likely to be\nthe best treatment option in patients with advanced well-differentiated NETs in terms\nof the beneﬁt–risk ratio. Numerous nonrandomized studies of PRRT have consistently\ndemonstrated high response rates and prolonged PFS in patients with GEP-NETs. In a more\nrecent randomized phase III trial, PRRT plus the best supportive care provided a longer PFS\nthan high-dose octreotide, and did so with limited serious adverse events (SAEs) in patients\nwith advanced midgut NETs.', 'Lutetium-177- DOTATATE/\nDOTATOC for treatment of\nGastroenteropancreatic NETs\nNeuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) are relatively rare\nneoplasms which may arise from pluripotential stem cells in\naddition to cells of the diffuse neuroendocrine system\ncomprising the autonomic nervous system, the thyroid, lungs,\npancreas and gastrointestinal tract ( 2). The classi ﬁcation of NENs\nhas recently been updated by the WHO according to morphology\nand proliferation as well differentiated neuroendocrine tumors\n(NETs) (G1 to G3) and poorly differentiated neuroendocrine\ncarcinomas (NECs) (G3) ( Table 2 )(3).\nNETs may be clinically silent ( ‘non-functioning ’) or may\nsynthesize and secrete a variety of peptides and neuroamines\nwhich lead to the development of characteristic clinical\nsyndromes, including carcinoid syndrome and functional\npancreatic tumors such as insulinoma (hypoglycemia) and\ngastrinoma (gastric hyperacidity). The non-functioning tumors\ntend to present late with widespread metastatic disease,\nparticularly in the liver. NETss tend to be indolent in\ncharacter and patients can still live for relatively prolonged\nperiods with good quality of life even with metastatic disease ( 4).\nThe incidence of NENs is increasing year-on-year. In the\nUSA, the SEER database has documented a 6,4-fold increase in\nincidence between 2007 (1,09 per 100.000) and 2012 (6,98 per\n100.000) ( 5). This increase has included gastroenteropancreatic\n(GEP) NENs with the highest incidence being seen in adults\naged 74-80) ( 6) The age-standardized incidence rate of NENs in\nthe UK between 2013-2015 has been reported as 8.6 per 100,000,\nwith an incidence of 4.6 per 100,000 for gastroenteropancreatic\n(GEP) NENs ( 7).\nGEP-NETs are graded with increasing aggressivity as G1, G2\nor G3, based on Ki-67 labeling index, mitotic count and\nhistological differentiation ( Table 2 )(3). Well differentiated G1\nand G2 GEP-NETs typically show a slower progression and better\nprognosis than G3 GEP-NETs ( 8). A characteristic feature ofGEP-NETs is that a majority express functioning somatostatin\nreceptors (SSTRs) 2 and 5. This renders the tumors amenable to\ntreatment with synthetic somatostatin peptides, which can inhibit\nfunctional secretion and also stabilize tumor growth ( 9). These\nsynthetic peptides, conjugated with a chelator, can be ef ﬁciently\nradiolabeled with photon-, positron- or particle-emitting\nradionuclides. The expression of SSTR2 enables GEP-NETs to\nbe imaged with receptor targeted high resolution PET/CT(DOTATOC/DOTATATE-Ga-68). In addition, tumors can be\ntreated with therapeutic Lu-177 DOTATOC/DOTATATE ( 10).\nPatients with G1 and G2 GEP-NETS often present late, with\nmetastatic disease. Until recently, somatostatin analogues and\nthe molecularly targeted drugs Sunitinib andEverolimus as well\nas chemotherapy in PNETs have provided the mainstays of\ntreatment ( 11). These treatments usually result in disease\nstabilization for a limited period of time. In the RADIANT-3\ntrial, Everolimus achieved a progression free survival (PFS) of 11\nmonths in pancreatic NETS (PNETs) and a similar PFS was\nachieved in midgut and pulmonary NETs in the RADIANT-4\ntrial ( 12,13).\nPRRT has recently emerged as a novel treatment option for\npatients with G1 and G2 GEP-NETs.', 'Cancers 2022 ,14, 5792 7 of 17\ncompared to 11.0 months for sunitinib treatment in patients with advanced, SSTR-positive,\nprogressive panNET [ 70]. Currently, the randomized phase III COMPETE trial is comparing\nPRRT with177Lu-edotreotide with everolimus in advanced, progressive GEP-NET patients.\nA subset of GEP-NET patients present with extensive tumor bulk or high proliferative rate\n(Ki-67 index of 10–55%). In these cases, treatment with octreotide LAR or lanreotide has\nquestionable antiproliferative effects [ 71]. Given its ORR of 39%, which increases to 55% in\npanNETs [ 29],177Lu-DOTATATE can be considered as ﬁrst-line therapy if response is clini-\ncally necessitated [ 72]. These response rates compare favorably to targeted therapy [ 73–75]\nand for panNETs appear similar to capecitabine–temozolomide chemotherapy [ 76]. Poorly\ndifferentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs) and well-differentiated grade 3 NETs\nare high-grade NENs that display a more aggressive biological behavior than the more\ncommon grade 1 and 2 NETs [ 77]. PRRT is currently not considered a standard treatment\noption for high-grade NENs [68,78]. The rate of SSTR 2expression in grade 3 NETs ranges\nfrom 67–92% and in NECs from 32–50%, compared to a positive expression rate in grade 1\nand 2 NETs ranging from 67–96% [ 5,79–82]. In a meta-analysis of PRRT comprising four\nstudies, grade 3 NET patients had a median PFS of 19 months and median OS of 44 months\nafter PRRT. The median PFS was 11 and 4 months and the median OS was 22 and 9 months\nfor NEC with a Ki-67 of 21–55% and NEC with a Ki-67 above 55%, respectively [ 83]. Recent\nstudies implicated that PRRT could be considered in grade 3 GEP-NETs and GEP-NEC\nwith a Ki-67 of 21–55%. Importantly, to qualify for PRRT, uptake in all lesions is required\non somatostatin receptor imaging [83].\n7. Eligibility Criteria for PRRT\nThere are several inclusion and exclusion criteria to decide if a patient is eligible for\ntreatment with PRRT. A key criterion for PRRT is the degree of uptake on SSTR imaging\nwhich is scored by the Krenning score based on planar111In-DTPA-octereotide imaging.\nIt was reported that68Ga-DOTA-SSA PET/CT results in higher Krenning scores than\n111In-DTPA-octereotide imaging [ 84]. The uptake of all tumor lesions should minimally\nbe equal to the physiological uptake in the liver (Krenning score grade 2) on111In-DTPA-\noctreotide scintigraphy or higher than the physiological uptake in the liver on68Ga-DOTA-\nSSA PET/CT for a patient to be eligible for PRRT. The latter functional imaging is more\naccurate for detecting SSTR-positive primary tumors and metastases and therefore su-\nperior for assessing the total extent of disease [ 85–87]. PRRT is only applicable for pa-\ntients with a Karnofsky Performance Scale of at least 60 [ 27]. PRRT is contra-indicated\nfor patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding, patients with severe cardiac impairment\n(NYHA III or IV) and those with a life expectancy less than 3 months [ 31]. Since PRRT\ncan induce toxicity, the following pre-treatment laboratory values are required: creatinine\nclearance > 40 mL/min, hemoglobin levels ≥6 mmol/L, leukocytes > 2 ×109/L, platelet\ncount > 75 ×109/L, bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) and aspartate aminotrans-\nferase (ASAT) < 3 times the upper limit of normal and albumin > 3 g/dL [2,3].\n8.']",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1.0,1.0,1.0,110
1E advanced RAG,What is the role of PRRT in GEP-NET?,english,general,therapy,gpt-4o advanced RAG,"Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT) plays a significant role in the treatment of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs). PRRT has been shown to improve progression-free survival (PFS) and patient quality of life, particularly in patients with well-differentiated G1 and G2 GEP-NETs (Rogoza et al., 2022, p. 15). The NETTER-1 Phase III trial validated the effectiveness and low toxicity of PRRT, leading to its approval by the US FDA and the European Medicines Agency for treating well-differentiated GEP-NETs (Camus et al., 2021, p. 2). PRRT is particularly beneficial for patients who express somatostatin receptors (SSTRs), as the therapy targets these receptors to deliver radiolabeled somatostatin analogues directly to the tumor cells, thereby minimizing toxicity to healthy cells (Camus et al., 2021, p. 2). Additionally, PRRT has shown high response rates and prolonged PFS in nonrandomized studies, making it a promising treatment option for advanced well-differentiated NETs (Rogoza et al., 2022, p. 15).","['Int.

This increase has included gastroenteropancreatic\n(GEP) NENs with the highest incidence being seen in adults\naged 74-80) ( 6) The age-standardized incidence rate of NENs in\nthe UK between 2013-2015 has been reported as 8.6 per 100,000,\nwith an incidence of 4.6 per 100,000 for gastroenteropancreatic\n(GEP) NENs ( 7).\nGEP-NETs are graded with increasing aggressivity as G1, G2\nor G3, based on Ki-67 labeling index, mitotic count and\nhistological differentiation ( Table 2 )(3). Well differentiated G1\nand G2 GEP-NETs typically show a slower progression and better\nprognosis than G3 GEP-NETs ( 8). A characteristic feature ofGEP-NETs is that a majority express functioning somatostatin\nreceptors (SSTRs) 2 and 5. This renders the tumors amenable to\ntreatment with synthetic somatostatin peptides, which can inhibit\nfunctional secretion and also stabilize tumor growth ( 9). These\nsynthetic peptides, conjugated with a chelator, can be ef ﬁciently\nradiolabeled with photon-, positron- or particle-emitting\nradionuclides. The expression of SSTR2 enables GEP-NETs to\nbe imaged with receptor targeted high resolution PET/CT(DOTATOC/DOTATATE-Ga-68). In addition, tumors can be\ntreated with therapeutic Lu-177 DOTATOC/DOTATATE ( 10).\nPatients with G1 and G2 GEP-NETS often present late, with\nmetastatic disease. Until recently, somatostatin analogues and\nthe molecularly targeted drugs Sunitinib andEverolimus as well\nas chemotherapy in PNETs have provided the mainstays of\ntreatment ( 11). These treatments usually result in disease\nstabilization for a limited period of time. In the RADIANT-3\ntrial, Everolimus achieved a progression free survival (PFS) of 11\nmonths in pancreatic NETS (PNETs) and a similar PFS was\nachieved in midgut and pulmonary NETs in the RADIANT-4\ntrial ( 12,13).\nPRRT has recently emerged as a novel treatment option for\npatients with G1 and G2 GEP-NETs.', 'Cancers 2022 ,14, 5792 7 of 17\ncompared to 11.0 months for sunitinib treatment in patients with advanced, SSTR-positive,\nprogressive panNET [ 70]. Currently, the randomized phase III COMPETE trial is comparing\nPRRT with177Lu-edotreotide with everolimus in advanced, progressive GEP-NET patients.\nA subset of GEP-NET patients present with extensive tumor bulk or high proliferative rate\n(Ki-67 index of 10–55%). In these cases, treatment with octreotide LAR or lanreotide has\nquestionable antiproliferative effects [ 71]. Given its ORR of 39%, which increases to 55% in\npanNETs [ 29],177Lu-DOTATATE can be considered as ﬁrst-line therapy if response is clini-\ncally necessitated [ 72]. These response rates compare favorably to targeted therapy [ 73–75]\nand for panNETs appear similar to capecitabine–temozolomide chemotherapy [ 76]. Poorly\ndifferentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs) and well-differentiated grade 3 NETs\nare high-grade NENs that display a more aggressive biological behavior than the more\ncommon grade 1 and 2 NETs [ 77]. PRRT is currently not considered a standard treatment\noption for high-grade NENs [68,78]. The rate of SSTR 2expression in grade 3 NETs ranges\nfrom 67–92% and in NECs from 32–50%, compared to a positive expression rate in grade 1\nand 2 NETs ranging from 67–96% [ 5,79–82]. In a meta-analysis of PRRT comprising four\nstudies, grade 3 NET patients had a median PFS of 19 months and median OS of 44 months\nafter PRRT. The median PFS was 11 and 4 months and the median OS was 22 and 9 months\nfor NEC with a Ki-67 of 21–55% and NEC with a Ki-67 above 55%, respectively [ 83]. Recent\nstudies implicated that PRRT could be considered in grade 3 GEP-NETs and GEP-NEC\nwith a Ki-67 of 21–55%. Importantly, to qualify for PRRT, uptake in all lesions is required\non somatostatin receptor imaging [83].\n7. Eligibility Criteria for PRRT\nThere are several inclusion and exclusion criteria to decide if a patient is eligible for\ntreatment with PRRT. A key criterion for PRRT is the degree of uptake on SSTR imaging\nwhich is scored by the Krenning score based on planar111In-DTPA-octereotide imaging.\nIt was reported that68Ga-DOTA-SSA PET/CT results in higher Krenning scores than\n111In-DTPA-octereotide imaging [ 84]. The uptake of all tumor lesions should minimally\nbe equal to the physiological uptake in the liver (Krenning score grade 2) on111In-DTPA-\noctreotide scintigraphy or higher than the physiological uptake in the liver on68Ga-DOTA-\nSSA PET/CT for a patient to be eligible for PRRT. The latter functional imaging is more\naccurate for detecting SSTR-positive primary tumors and metastases and therefore su-\nperior for assessing the total extent of disease [ 85–87]. PRRT is only applicable for pa-\ntients with a Karnofsky Performance Scale of at least 60 [ 27]. PRRT is contra-indicated\nfor patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding, patients with severe cardiac impairment\n(NYHA III or IV) and those with a life expectancy less than 3 months [ 31]. Since PRRT\ncan induce toxicity, the following pre-treatment laboratory values are required: creatinine\nclearance > 40 mL/min, hemoglobin levels ≥6 mmol/L, leukocytes > 2 ×109/L, platelet\ncount > 75 ×109/L, bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) and aspartate aminotrans-\nferase (ASAT) < 3 times the upper limit of normal and albumin > 3 g/dL [2,3].\n8.']",4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1.0,1.0,1.0,20
2E advanced RAG,For which indication is PRRT approved?,english,specific,therapy,gpt-4o advanced RAG,"PRRT is approved for the treatment of well-differentiated gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) that are SST-positive. Specifically, ^177Lu-DOTATATE received marketing authorization for this indication (Camus et al., 2021, p. 2; Fani et al., 2022, p. 4).","['J. Clin. Med. 2021 ,10, 1267 2 of 15\n(SSTR). For many years, evidence of an anti-tumor effect of PRRT were only obtained from\nnon-randomized Phase II trials or retrospective studies. The NETTER-1 Phase III Random-\nized Trial finally validated this treatment option by confirming its low toxicity but also its\neffectiveness in tumor control. Following these results,177Lu-DOTATATE was approved by\nthe US Food and Drug Administration in 2018 and the European Medicines Agency in 2017\nfor the treatment of gastroenteropancreatic NETs that are well differentiated and obtain a\nprescription authorization in France in metastatic midgut NETs [ 2]. Some interesting data\nexist for pancreatic and pulmonary NETs. In this review, we discuss the clinical efficiency of\nPRRT in gastroenteropancreatic and pulmonary NETs.\n2. Somatostatin Receptors (SSTR) and Radio-Labelled Somatostatin Analogues\nEffect of PRRT is correlated with the ability for the markers to ﬁx the SSTR (SSTR1-5).\nThis therapy is therefore dedicated to NETs who strongly over expressed those receptors.\nSSTRs belong to a family of G-protein coupled receptors with seven transmembrane\ndomains. The majority of well differentiated gastroenteropancreatic and pulmonary NETs\nare characterized by the strong expression of SSTR, including SSTR2 Grade 1/2 NETs\nexpress the SSTR more often and at higher levels than grade 3 NETs. When linked to the\nreceptors, radiolabeled somatostatin analogues are internalized according to the normal\nrecycling dynamics of membrane receptors and the degradation products of peptides\nare stored in lysosomes, in intracellular, which allows for the release and retention of\nradioactivity inside tumor cells [ 3]. This mechanism accounts for the low toxicity of the\nPRRT on the healthy cells. Radiolabelled somatostatin analogs are made up of an isotope\nradionuclide, a carrier molecule (derived from octreotide), and a chelating agent that binds\nthem together and stabilizes the complex. The commonly used chelating agents are DOTA\n(DOTA acid and tetra-azacyclododecane-tetra-acetic) and DTPA (di-ethylenetriamine penta-\naceticacid). Three radionucleides (111In,90Y and177Lu) were conjugated to the somatostatin\nanalogues and their different physical characteristics confer speciﬁc advantages. The90Y\nand177Lu emit beta particles with higher energy and longer ranges, which translates into\ngreater therapeutic potential. Due to the emission of gamma rays, the177Lu can also be\nused for dosimetry and monitoring of tumor response [4].\n3. Modalities of Realization and Patients Selection\nPRRT is the single validated treatment option in the NETs, which for there is a pre-\ndictive marker of answer: the expression of SSTR. Response rates have been shown to\nbe increased in patients with a higher degree of absorption of radiotracers in the case of\n111In-pentetreotid scintigraphy An overall response rate of approximately 60% has been\nreported in patients with a grade 4 according to the Krenning score, corresponding to a tu-\nmor absorption greater than that of the spleen, and kidneys. Intense ﬁxation (SUV) greater\nthan 16 on the68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT is a predictive marker of high tumor response\n(sensitivity: 95%; specﬁcity: 60 %) [ 5] (Figure 1). The effectiveness of PRRT is correlated\nwith the tumor volume and the location of the primary tumor (amount of SSTR present\non the tumor cell) (Figure 2). Thus, NETs with high liver tumor volume are considered\nto be less sensitive to PRRT [ 6]. Similarly, it is suggested that pancreatic NETs frequently\nrespond to the PRRT but with an earlier progression than in midgut NETs. The treatment\nmodalities are relatively standardized in France with a treatment carried out by infusion\nof radiolabel split in four cycles spaced eight weeks apart.', 'J. Clin. Med. 2021 ,10, 1267 4 of 15\n4. Indications of PRRT in NETs\n4.1. Gastrointestinal NET\nStudies on the role of PRRT in Grade 1–2 gastrointestinal NETs were evaluated with\ntwo different plotters:90Y-DOTATOC and177Lu-DOTATATE. The use of90Y-DOTATOC\nat a dose of 3.7 GBq/m2in 1109 patients with gastrointestinal NET ( n= 387), pancreatic\n(n= 342), pulmonary ( n= 84) or other ( n= 296) showed a morphologic response rate by\n34% measured by a decrease in the sum of the longest diameters of all pretherapeutically\ndetected tumor lesions. to the response assessment criteria usual radiological RECIST.\nIn patients with intestinal and pancreatic NET, the levels of objective responses were\n47% and 27%, respectively. In the overall population, the median of overall survival was\n95 months [ 7]. The comparison clinical trials and retrospective series on the PRRT with\nthe use of90Y-DOTATOC in the gastroenteropancreatic NETs is impossible because the\npatient selection procedures, the criteria for ﬁxation of the tracer to pre-therapeutic imaging,\nand infusion protocols differ widely in function of the studies. Currently, based on the\nNETTER-1 study, the177LuDOTATATE- is the most widely used radiopeptide.\n177Lu-DOTATATE is currently the more widely used radiopeptide. This radiolabel has\ndemonstrated an efﬁciency similar to90Y-DOTATOC, but with lower toxicity, especially\nhematologic (Table 1, [ 2,8–14]). In a serie of 310 patients treated for Gastroenteropancreatic\nNET per four cycles of 7.4 GBq of177Lu-DOTATATE, it was found an objective response\nrate of 30%. Poor general condition (Karnofsky score < 70%) and liver damage were\nassociated with an incorrect response to the treatment. For example,177Lu-DOTATATE and\n90Y-DOTATOC treatments are associated with poor results when tumor volume is high [ 15].\nIn a meta-analysis of 473 patients treated with177Lu-DOTATATE for a NET, objective\nresponse rates ranged from 18% to 44% depending on the RECIST criteria, with an average\ndisease control rate of 81% [ 16]. Retrospective and Phase II studies of177Lu-DOTATATE\nshowed a median progression-free survival of 33–36 months in patients with metastatic\nsmall size NET with documented tumor progression and/or an uncontrolled carcinoid\nsymptom [8].\nIn this context, the NETTER-1 (Phase III randomized study) has evaluated and po-\nsitioned the place of the PRRT at a very early stage in the management of patients with\nmetastatical midgut NET [ 2]. This study compared 229 patients with advanced metastatic\nmidgut NET, an Octreoscanner binding and progression under SSA at a ﬁxed dose of 30 mg\nper month Octreotide,177Lu-DOTATATE versus 60 mg per month of Octreotide (double\ndose). The study’s outcome was progression-free survival evaluated according to the radio-\nlogical criteria RECIST 1.1. The treatment with177Lu-DOTATATE resulted in a reduction of\n79% of the risk of progression or death, compared to double-dose Octreotide (p< 0.0001) .\nThe median survival progression was not reached in the group treated with PRRT versus\n8.4 months in the control group. Moreover, treatment with PRRT was associated with\na rate of objective response of 18% versus 3% with Octreotide ( p< 0.0004). Thus, and\nbased on this Phase III data,177Lu-DOTATATE is positioned as a new therapeutic option\nin grade 1–2 midgut NETs after disease progression under SSA and has been obtained\nmarketing authorization for this indication. It is important to note that long-term follow-up\nis necessary in order to assess the impact of this new treatment on the overall patient\nsurvival.', '2.2. Clinical Studies and Approvals\nToday, PRRT with radiolabeled SST agonists (e.g., DOTA-TOC or DOTA-TATE, Table 1)\nis part of the standard of care of NENs. NETTER-1 (NCT01578239; EudraCT number\n2011-005049-11 ) was the ﬁrst prospective, open-label, randomized, phase III trial to com-\npare four cycles of177Lu-DOTA-TATE (4 ×7.4 GBq) plus 30 mg long-acting release oc-\ntreotide (PRRT group, n = 117) with high-dose (60 mg double dose) long-acting release\noctreotide (control group, n = 114) in advanced, progressive midgut NET patients. There\nwas a signiﬁcantly longer progression-free survival for the PRRT arm ( p< 0.001) [ 22]\nand a signiﬁcant improvement in quality of life [ 23]. Consequently,177Lu-DOTA-TATE\n(177Lu-oxodotreotide ) received marketing authorization for the treatment of adult patients\nwith SST-positive gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs). At the ﬁnal\nanalysis of overall survival (OS), the median OS was improved by 11.7 months for the\n177Lu-DOTA-TATE arm versus the control arm (48.0 (95% CI, 37.4–55.2) vs. 36.3 (95% CI,\n25.9–51.7) months, respectively), which, however, did not reach statistical signiﬁcance in the\nlong-term follow-up with a median of 6.3 years [ 24]. Regarding safety, the NETTER-1 data\nshow a low incidence of long-term side-effects regarding hematotoxicity and nephrotoxicity.\nCurrently , a second prospective, randomized, controlled, open-label, multi-center, phase\nIII trial, COMPETE (NCT03049189), is ongoing, in which PRRT using177Lu-DOTA-TOC\n(177Lu-edotreotide, four cycles with 7.5 GBq/cycle) is being compared with the mTOR\ninhibitor everolimus (10 mg daily) in patients with progressive, SST-positive GEP-NETs.\nUpon completion of the study, the approval of177Lu-DOTA-TOC is expected. These\ntrials and other trials (e.g., OCCLURANDOM, NCT02230176) should further precisely\ndetermine the position of PRRT in the current clinical algorithm with regard to other\nsystemic therapies, such as everolimus and sunitinib.\nUsing routes other than intravenous administration may be an interesting approach to\nenhance the therapeutic and safety window of PRRT. NENs and their liver metastases are\noften highly perfused, and the intra-arterial route can exploit the ﬁrst-pass effect to treat\nliver-dominant disease more efﬁciently. Such an approach can also be used for inoperable\nprimary tumors to downstage the disease in the neoadjuvant setting [ 25,26]. However,\nlarge comparative prospective trials supporting its wider use are missing.']",4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1.0,1.0,1.0,35

The 2-year progression-free\nsurvival rate was not significantly different between bothgroups (67% in neoadjuvant vs. 58% in control groups), but\nthere was a lower risk of pancreatic fistula in the neoadjuvant\ngroup (25 vs. 65%) with comparable rates of complications (45vs. 60%).\nAdjuvant PRRT\nPRRT may also be used in an adjuvant setting after surgery ofGEP-NETs, preventing tumor growth after surgical manipula-tion or preventing further growth of pre-existing\nmicrometastases. Unfortunately, only a handful of studiesare available on postoperative treatment with PRRT. Thereare no published randomized trials on adjuvant PRRT favor-\ning any evidence on the best treatment approach in this subset\nof patients.\nOne study [ 48]i n c l u d e dp a t i e n t sw i t hG 1 –G2 pNETs and\nsynchronous liver metastases who were not eligible for liversurgery but were amenable to upfront PRRT. The prospectivestudy followed 94 patients, 31 of whom previously underwent\nprimary resection while the rest had no previous surgeries\nperformed. Both groups were treated with PRRT, either\n90Y-\nDOTATOC or177Lu-DOTATATE. The resection of the prima-\nry tumor was significantly associated with better PR or SDafter PRRT and longer median PFS and OS for operated ver-sus non-operated patients. In this study, only patients with\nsynchronous pNET and liver metastases treated with PRRT\nwere considered, excluding those who underwent primary tu-mor and liver surgery with radical intent. Patients affected by a\nG3 tumor according to the WHO 2010 classification and those\nwho had undergone PRRT at disease progression under so-matostatin analogs were excluded.\nEven though it did not cover surgery per se, one study [ 49]\ncompared patients who received PRRTwho had received priorchemo or radionuclide hepatic embolization (CRHE) with\nthose who did not have any prior history of such intervention.\nA total of 70% of patients who had CRHE (compared to56.5% who did not) experienced benefit from\n177Lu PRRT,\nand 21.6% who had CRHE (compared to 35.8% who did not)experienced progression. Patients with a pervious history of\nCRHE also showed more SD and less PD following PRRT\nwhen compared to the patients who did not have any priorCRHE, but the probability of developing CR and PR is not\nstatistically different between both groups.\nTo detect a difference in survival and/or tumor recurrence\nrate in patients treated with and without adjuvant PRRT, alarge, multicenter trial with several years of follow-up would\nbe needed.Nucl Med Mol Imaging (2018) 52:190 –199 195', 'receiving the same combination. Authors report a CR of 13%\nand PR of 70%, with no patients manifesting a PD, and the\nmedian PFS was 48 months. Both of these studies were un-controlled and nonrandomized clinical trials. In a retrospective\nstudy, Kashyap et al. [ 37] showed favorable outcomes in pa-\ntients with\n18F-FDG PET-positive GEP-NETs with advanced\nprogressive68Ga-octreotate PET-avid disease with a combi-\nnation of 5-FU and177Lu-octreotate. Among 52 patients, they\nreport CR in 2%, PR 28%, SD 68%, and PD in only 2% of\npatients with median PFS 48 months.\nA recent randomized clinical trial by Ballal et al. [ 38]\nestablished clinical efficacy of177Lu-DOTATATE combina-\ntion with capecitabine over PRRT alone. According to\nRECIST 1.1 criteria, in the combination group, PR was\nachieved in 34%, SD in 50.2%, and PD in 6.8% of patients(compared to 6.3, 60.9, and 26.5% in the PRRT-only group,\nrespectively), and the combination group was shown to have\nlonger OS and PFS. No significant differences in hematolog-ical toxicity or hepatotoxicity were reported between both\ngroups.\nNeoadjuvant PRRT\nThe use of PRRT in patients with inoperable pNETs as neo-\nadjuvant therapy, targeting tumor shrinkage, and making it\nmore amenable to surgery is very promising. There are some\ncase reports describing the use of neoadjuvant PRRT, partic-ularly 90Y-DOTATATE in patients with pancreatic NETs who\ncould be operated on successfully after PRRT [ 39–42].\nEzzidin et al. [ 43] reported a patient with pNET and liver\nmetastases who received neoadjuvant therapy with\n177Lu-\noctreotate. There was a partial response with tumor shrinkage\nand a small residual metastatic liver lesion. The primary tumorwas then completely resected and the patient remained in CR\nlocally for 22 months postoperatively. Barber et al. [ 44]r e -\nported treating five patients with inoperable NETs with the\ncombination of\n177Lu-octreotate and 5-FU. One of them\nunderwent subsequent complete surgical resection andremained 12 months postoperatively alive and free of disease.\nVan Vliet and colleagues [ 45] studied 29 patients with a\npathology-proven nonfunctioning pNETs treated with\n177Lu-\noctreotate. After treatment, successful surgery was performedin nine patients (31%). The median PFS was 69 months for\npatients with successful surgery and 49 months for the other\npatients. Hence, neoadjuvant treatment with\n177Lu-octreotate\nis a valuable option for patients with initially unresectablepNETs.\nKwekkeboom et al. [ 46] retrospectively studied 310 patients\nwith pNETs who received treatment with\n177Lu-octreotate.\nFour patients with partially res ponding nonfunctioning pNETs\nwere able to undergo complete surgical resection. One of them\ndied postoperatively from surgi cal complications. Recently, a\nstudy abstract from the European Pancreatic Club (EPC) 2017meeting [ 47] compared patients with initially metastatic and/or\nlocally advanced pNETs who underwent neoadjuvant PRRT\nwith a group of patients who underwent upfront surgery.After PRRT, tumor size decreased from 59 to 50 mm, and the\nrate of curative resection was 65%.

PRRT seems a promising tool for SST-positive locally advanced NF-Pan-NET or even tumours with limited\ndistant metastasis (oligometastatic disease). The first clinical study by\nPartelli et al. in 2018 retrospectively compared 23 patients operatedafter PRRT with patients who had undergone upfront resection.\n48In\naddition to a higher R0 resection rate and less positive lymph nodes\nin the PRRT group, the postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) ratedecreased, which might be an important safety issue after this compli-\ncated type of surgery with POPF as its most dreadful complication.\nThese data must be validated in a prospective study, one of such hasrecently completed the accrual (ClinicalTrial.gov Identifier:NCT04385992), and results will be expected in 2023. Another study\nfrom India\n49assessed 57 patients with unresectable primary tumours\nof pancreatic or duodenal origin and/or potentially resectable oligo-metastatic liver lesions. PRRT with\n177Lu-DOTATATE lead to a com-\nplete or partial response in 84% of patients, and one out of four\npatients became resectable. Although these data has to be viewedwith caution due to its retrospective nature and high risk of bias, this\ntreatment strategy seems at least safe and feasible.\nIn clinical practice, chemotherapy is another potentially effective\ntreatment for neoadjuvant/preoperative purposes, given the poten-\ntially high response rate associated with this therapeutic option. How-\never, there is a need for clinical trials to assess the role ofchemotherapy in these specific settings.\n3.1.4 | Recommendations\n1.

Diese Therapie verwendet radiolabelierte Somatostatin-Analoga wie DOTATOC, DOTATATE und DOTANOC, die entweder mit ^90Y oder ^177Lu markiert sind. Die radiolabelierten Peptide binden an die SSTRs auf den Tumorzellen, werden internalisiert und setzen Radioaktivität frei, die DNA-Schäden verursacht und letztlich zum Zelltod führt (Hirmas et al., 2018, S. 191-192; Camus et al., 2021, S. 2).","['If GEP-NETS are resectable, surgery is the primary ap-\nproach. Patients with unresectable metastatic disease usually\ngo through multiple lines of treatments including somatostatin\nanalogue (SSA) therapy or targeted therapy, such as everoli-mus (mTOR inhibitor) or sunitinib (tyrosine kinase inhibitor)\n[7]. In patients with grade 1 and 2 NETs (Ki-7 LI of up to\n20%) that are inoperable and metastatic, who have failed first-\nline somatostatin treatment, and whose tumors express high\nlevels of somatostatin receptors (SSTRs), peptide receptor ra-\ndionuclide therapy (PRRT) would be a viable option.

Patients included in study\nprotocols have positive NET histology and SSTR scintigraphy\nwith111In OctreoScan or68Ga PET-Dota-peptide (Fig. 1). A\npositive scan denotes lesion uptake that is equal to or greaterthan the liver uptake [ 8]. Important criteria to be taken into\naccount when considering PRRT include objective disease\nprogression, adequate blood profile (hemoglobin, white cell,\nand platelet count levels), creatinine, and ECOG performancescore ≤2[8]. A good performance status means the patient\nwould be self-sufficient and reduces the need for physicalassistance during the treatment period (3 days/cycle).Recently published European Society for Medical Oncology\n(ESMO) Clinical Practice Guidelines have recommended\nPRRT up to the upper limit of Ki-67 LI to 30% [ 9].\nScintigraphic or PET tomoscintigraphic evaluation is to datethe most accurate noninvasive method to identify and confirmthe overexpression of functioning receptors [ 10]. An impor-\ntant issue in the consideration of PRRT is that the somatostatinreceptors should be functional, i.e., able to internalize the re-ceptor analogue complex and retain the radioactivity inside\nthe cell. The critical issues for effective therapy are somato-\nstatin receptor overexpression and the evidence of functional-ity. The nuclear physician can calculate a tumor-to-liver ratio\nas a relative measure of receptor number [ 11]; this ratio must\nbe high for PRRT eligibility.Mechanism of Action and Constituents\nof Radiolabeled SSAs\nSomatostatin ’s actions include inhibiting hormone secretion,\nsuppressing the release of insulin-like growth factors,\ninhibiting angiogenesis, and inducing apoptosis in the tumor\ntissue [ 12]. Such biologic effects are mediated through inter-\naction with five subtypes of somatostatin receptors (SSTR1-\n5), which belong to the seven-transmembrane domain, G-\nprotein-coupled receptor superfamily. The currently approvedSSAs are octreotide and lanreotide, in slow-release formula-\ntions, long-acting release (LAR), and supersaturated solution\n(Autogel®).\nDue to the overexpression of SSTRs in NETs, which is\nestimated to be in around 80% of NETs, they are consideredsuitable targets for PRRT with radiolabeled SSA. Once boundto their receptor, radiolabeled SSAs are internalized as per\nnormal receptor recycling dynamics, and the breakdown prod-\nucts of the radiolabeled peptides are stored in lysosomes, thusenabling delivery and causing suspension of radioactivity in-\nside the tumor cell [ 13]. This would result in radiation-induced\nDNA damage of the tumor cell and its eventual death.\nRadiolabeled SSAs are made up of three main constituents;\na radionuclide isotope, a ligand or carrier molecule (TOC or\nTATE), and a chelator or linker (DOTA) that binds them to-\ngether and stabilizes the complex (Fig. 2). Chelators mainly\nused include DOTA (tetraazacyclododecane tetra-acetic acid)\nand DTPA (diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid), while\noctreotide and octreotate (TOC and TATE, respectively) are\ngenerally used as ligands [ 14]. The most known and studied\nSSA is octreotide.', 'Symptomatic relief was encountered in this therapy in patients\nwith metastasized GEP-NETs. However, objective tumor re-sponses were rare [ 15,16]. The next generation of analogues\nused in PRRT consisted of [Tyr3]octreotide as a somatostatinanalogue and DOTA as a chelator (instead of DTPA), whichallows stable binding of the β-emitting radionuclide\n90Y . Its\nmaximal tissue penetration is 12 mm and its half-life is2.7 days. [\n90Y-DOTA0,Tyr3]octreotide (90Y-DOTATOC) was\nused in multiple phase I and phase II PRRT trials across sev-\neral countries [ 17–24], with reported objective responses rang-\ning from 4 to 33%. It is mainly due to differences in cycle\ndoses, administered cumulative dose, as well as variabilities\nin patients ’characteristics (such as various tumor types and\npatient performance statuses) that make these studies very dif-\nficult to compare. Different studies report median progression-free survival (PFS) varying from 17 to 29 months and medianoverall survival (OS) from 22 to 37 months [ 21–24].\n177Lu-DOTATATE is currently the most widely used\nradiopeptide for PRRT [ 21]. It has shown similar efficacy\nwhen compared to90Y-DOTATOC, while showing a more\nfavorable toxicity profile, especially when speaking of hema-\ntological and renal toxicity [ 25,26]. In a recent study on bron-\nchial and GEP-NETs, Brabander et al. [ 27] evaluated safety,\nefficacy and toxicity of177Lu-DOTATATE and showed im-\npressive results. The objective response rate (ORR) reached\n39%, stable disease (SD) was reported in 43% of patients, andthe PFS and OS for all NET patients were 29 and 63 months,\nrespectively (Fig. 3).\nWith time, the use of PRRT which initially targeted\nNETs was extended to other types of confirmed SSTR-positive tumors. Tumors such as breast cancer, lymphoma,\nglioma, meningioma, and paraganglioma, as well as non-\niodine-absorbing differentiated thyroid cancer can now be\nconsidered for PRRT when registered therapies have failed[8].\n177Lu Radionuclide and NETTER-1 Trial\nThe Neuroendocrine Tumors Therapy (NETTER-1) trial is thefirst randomized controlled trial that evaluated the efficacy\nFig. 1 aMIP image of68Ga\nDOTATOC PET shows the\nprimary NET in the small bowel\non the right side of the abdomen\n(red arrow) with extensive livermetastases, both demonstratingintense increased radiotracer\nuptake reflecting the high\nexpression of the somatostatinreceptors.

Mechanism of Action\nPRRT with177Lu-DOTATATE uses an intravenously administered beta radiation-\nemitting radiopharmaceutical targeting SSTR on tumor cells. SSTRs are G-protein coupled\nreceptors with ﬁve subtypes of which subtype 2 (SSTR 2) is the most commonly expressed\nin NETs, followed by SSTR 1and SSTR 5[5,6]. Healthy non-diseased organs can also express\nSSTR subtypes, as can be seen in the healthy liver, spleen, pituitary, salivary glands, thyroid,\nadrenals, kidney, prostate, pancreas, intestine and blood vessels [ 7–9]. The antitumoral\neffect of PRRT is triggered by radiation-induced DNA damage. After binding to the SSTR 2,\nthe radiopharmaceutical agonists are internalized into the tumor cell where the irradiation\ninduces different types of DNA damage such as DNA single strand breaks (SSBs) and DNA\ndouble strand breaks (DSBs) of which the latter are the major contributors to tumor cell\ndeath induction [10,11] (Figure 1).\nCancers 2022 , 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW  2 of 18  \n SSAs target the somatostatin receptor (SSTR) subtype 2 that is over -expressed on the can-\ncer cell surface [4] .

Mechanism of Action  \nPRRT with \n177Lu-DOTATATE uses an intravenously administered beta radiation -\nemitting radiopharmaceutical targeting SSTR on tumor cells.

5G advanced RAG,Wie viele PRRT-Behandlungen kann man bekommen?,german,specific,therapy,gpt-4o advanced RAG,"Man kann in der Regel vier bis fünf PRRT-Behandlungen erhalten (Hirmas et al., 2018, S. 196).","['The patients were divided into two groups: PRRT monotherapy ( n=81, group 1) and PRRT\nplus SSA ( n=87, group 2). The results showed a higher median PFS (48 months) in the subgroup\nreceiving the combination therapy, compared to the subgroup receiving only PRRT (27 months) [ 95].\nAccordingly, di ﬀerent experimental approaches and strategies are being explored in order to optimize\nthe eﬀectiveness of PRRT and to minimize potential side e ﬀects. First of all, after completing four\ncycles of PRRT, treatment may even be continued, depending on kidney and bone marrow tolerance,\ne.g., with reduced radioactivity as part of a salvage therapy (Re-PRRT) [ 96]. Van der Zwan et al.\ndemonstrated that a cumulative dose of up to 60.5 GBq salvage PRRT with 177Lu-DOTATATE is safe\nand e ﬀective in patients with progressive disease (relapse-PD) after four cycles of 177Lu-DOTATATE\nPRRT [ 97]. Furthermore, no increasing incidence of acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic\nsyndrome was observed, and no grade III or IV nephrotoxicity occurred [ 97]. Further intensiﬁcation\nof the PRRT might be even achieved by administration of the tracer directly into the hepatic artery.\nIn particular, patients with hepatic dominant metastases would beneﬁt from this approach due to\nan increase of uptake of the radiopharmaceutical (the so-called “ﬁrst-pass” e ﬀect) [ 98]. The PRRT is\nbecoming increasingly important in a neoadjuvant setting [ 99]. In patients with inoperable P-NET\nand distant (metastatic) disease, PRRT was associated with a signiﬁcant reduction in tumor size, and\nthe tumor was rendered operable [ 100]. In such cases, complete response can be achieved. Figure 1\ndemonstrates a representative case of PRRT in a neoadjuvant setting.', 'Cancers 2022 ,14, 5792 6 of 17\nwhich an antiemetic, typically ondansetron or granisetron, should be given prophylactically\nbefore the start of the infusion.177Lu-DOTATATE allows for post-therapy scintigraphy\nwith planar imaging or SPECT/CT. At patient discharge, the radiation exposure should be\nmeasured and patients should receive tailored advice on the duration of radiation safety\nprecautions at home, to avoid a high radiation exposure to other people, particularly children\nand pregnant women. Patients with NET-associated hormonal syndromes who have an\nindication for continuation of SSA use should adjust the moment of the injections to the\nPRRT cycles. Long-acting SSA should not be given within 4–6 weeks before a cycle of PRRT\nbecause of interference with the radiolabeled SSA. Although there is conflicting evidence\nfrom two limited single center studies whether continuation of SSA treatment is beneficial in\nnon-functioning NETs [ 63,64], this practice is often adopted. If the patient suffers from severe\nhormonal symptoms, short-acting SSA can be used to bridge this period up till 24 h before\nPRRT. Radiopharmaceuticals such as177Lu-DOTATATE need to be administered at specialized\nfacilities by medical personnel trained in radiation safety. These facilities should adhere to\nnational and international regulations on the use of radiopharmaceuticals and be licensed by\nthe regulatory authorities. Depending on local protocol and exposure regulations, PRRT with\n177Lu-DOTATATE can be given in an in-patient as well as an out-patient setting. In between\ncycles, patients should be reviewed for adverse effects, including full blood count and renal\nand liver function. Response evaluation by cross-sectional imaging is usually performed 2–3\nand 6 months after the last cycle of PRRT. Long-term follow-up is determined on an individual\nbasis taking into account the tumor biology and therapeutic response [ 65]. Pseudo-progression\nis a phenomenon that should be considered in the response evaluation when an increase in\ntumor size is seen during or short after treatment with PRRT. Pseudo-progression is probably\nbased on localized, temporarily edema caused by inflammation as a response to PRRT and\ndoes not show the actual tumor response to the therapy [ 58]. When pseudo-progression is\nsuspected, functional imaging (for example, PET/CT) can help differentiate between true\nprogression and pseudo-progression [31].\n5. Salvage PRRT\nIn NET patients who showed tumor response at least 18 months after the first cycle of\n177Lu-DOTATATE, re-treatment with PRRT (R-PRRT) with two additional cycles of 7.4 GBq\neach after renewed PD has shown antitumoral effects. In a meta-analysis on the effect of\nR-PRRT, the pooled median PFS was 14 months with a pooled median OS of 27 months.\nSimilarly, the pooled ORR was 17% with a disease control rate of 77%. Response rates,\nPFS and OS were lower than for initial PRRT [ 66], nonetheless R-PRRT remains a potential\noption for GEP-NET patients when other systemic treatment options are limited. The limited\nefficacy of R-PRRT as compared to initial PRRT might be explained by the administration\nof lower cumulative activity (i.e., generally half of the initial PRRT dosage) [ 51], the increase\nin tumor bulk at baseline before R-PRRT and potential changes in the tumor biology, such\nas a longitudinal increase in Ki-67. In the largest study to date by van der Zwan et al., no\ndifference in toxicity after R-PRRT as compared with initial PRRT was observed, particularly\nno increased occurrence of nephrotoxicity or significant hematological disease [ 67]. In cases\nwhere R-PRRT has provided additional benefit on tumor response and prolonged PFS, further\nre-treatment at the time of progression can be considered [67].\n6. Patient Selection\nPRRT with177Lu-DOTATATE is registered for patients with GEP-NETs that are pro-\ngressive on SSA treatment.', 'Salvage Treatment\nAlthough tumor response rates after initial treatment with\nPRRT are encouraging, CR is rare and eventually tumor pro-\ngression occurs in the majority of patients. Retreatment with\nextra cycles of PRRT as salvage therapy may be consideredwhen better options are not available. One study showed that\nsalvage therapy with two additional cycles of\n177Lu-octreotate\ndoes not lead to serious hematologic or nephrotoxic side ef-\nfects, but the tumor response rate was less compared with\ninitial treatment [ 50].\nAnother report showed that long PFS after the initial treat-\nment with PRRT predicts a prolonged PFS after salvage ther-apy [ 51], and argued that PRRT with\n177Lu-octreotate in the\nretreatment setting is a safe and effective option in patients\nwith metastatic GEP-NETs. For these reasons, retreatment\nseems a good option for patients who responded well after\nthe initial cycles of PRRT [ 52]. This novel and important\nconcept of salvage therapy of NET needs to be tested in large,\nprospective, and multi-center trials to contribute to evidence-\nbased findings.\nTreatment Side Effects\nPRRT is generally well-tolerated. Side effects can be divided to\nacute, subacute, and long-term side effects, as summarized inTable 4. Acute side effects are usually mild and self-limiting.\nNausea or vomiting are related to the concomitant admin-\nistration of kidney-protective amino acids. Subacute side\neffects are related to the radiopeptide itself, such as bonemarrow suppression, mild hair loss (observed with\n177Lu-\noctreotate), or, more rarely, an exacerbation of a clinicalsyndrome. The most common subacute side effect ofPRRT, occurring within 4 to 6 weeks after therapy, is bone\nmarrow suppression. Usually, the hematologic toxicity is\nmild and reversible. More serious WHO grade 3 or 4 tox-icity may occur, but this has been seen in less than 15% of\npatients [ 53].\nLong-term side effects of PRRT may include renal failure\nas well as leukemia/myelody splastic syndromes (MDS).\nBecause radiopeptides are usually reabsorbed in the proximal\ntubules, they can accumulate in the renal interstitium and in-duce inflammation and fibrosis with eventual kidney damage.\nCo-administration of positively charged amino acids results ina reduction of renal radioactive uptake, up to 40% as reportedin some studies [ 16,54]. If patients have long-standing or\npoorly controlled comorbidities such as diabetes and hyper-\ntension that affect kidney function, it is expected that there\nwould be a larger and more persistent decline in creatinine\nclearance [ 55].\nAdministration of Treatment\nFor purposes of kidney protection, positively charged amino\nacids, such as L-lysine and/or L-arginine, are co-infused to\ncompetitively inhibit the proximal tubular reabsorption ofthe radiopeptide [ 56].

Pulmonary NET\nLung NET are well differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (NET) classiﬁed as typical\ncarcinoids (TC: Ki-67 of up to 5%) or atypical carcinoids (AC: Ki-67 of up to 20%). Several\nstudies have evaluated PRRT in patients with pulmonary NETs and have reported similar\nresults to those observed in midgut NETs (Table 3, [ 9–13,28,29]). However, the indications\nare limited because several pulmonary NETs, especially carcinoids atypical tumors (AC),\nexpress relatively few SSTR2 and are therefore ineligible for this form of treatment [ 30].\nIn a study of 34 patients with TC and AC (56%) treatment with177Lu-DOTATATE was\nassociated with a low objective response rate of 15%. The median progression-free survival\nand overall survival were 19 and 49 months, respectively [28].\nLimited but promising data exists on90Y-DOTATOC efﬁcacy from 3 trials which\nhave included 12 bronchial NEN patients, with a 100% DCR reported using WHO tumor\nresponse criteria, with the ORR ranging from 0% to 50% [31].\nRecently, radio tracer activity (177Lu-DOTATATE and90Y-DOTATOC) has been evalu-\nated in single center series of 114 patients with pulmonary NET. The median progression-\nfree- and overall survivals were 28 and 59 months, respectively. Nephrotoxicity was more\nfrequently observed in patients who received90Y-DOTATOC [ 29]. Thus, to date, we have a\nbundle of arguments in favor of an effective of PRRT in the pulmonary NETs. These data\nargue for a phase III study in this situation.\n4.4. Retreatment PRRT after PRRT Failure\nAll patients treated with PRRT will experienced a progression of the disease within a few\nmonths to a few years. In the NETTER-1 study, only 30% of the patients had a progression\nof their disease at 20 months. The toxicity and efficacy of retreatment with additional cycles\nof PRRT have been evaluated in several small retrospective series. Twenty-seven patients\nprogressing after an initial response to90Y-DOTATOC have been treated again with177Lu-\nDOTATATE [ 32]. The rate of disease control was 70% and no serious toxicity has been\nreported [ 32]. More recently , a phase II study focused on retreatment with177Lu-DOTATATE\nat low doses (up to 18.5 GBq administered in 4–5cycles) in 26 patients who progressed at least\n12 months after starting treatment with90Y-DOTATOC. The median progression-free survival\nwas 22 months, and the disease control rate was 85% [ 33]. Overall, PRRT retreatment in NETs\nappeared to be associated with low toxicity , a lower tumor burden and a lower progression-\nfree survival than the first PRRT treatment. The retreatment may be discussed again in\npatients with a very good tolerance of the initial treatment and a prolonged response. Future\nstudies will be required in order to identify the place for PRRT retreatment in comparison to\nvalidated treatments (targeted therapies, chemotherapy).\n4.5. Side Effects of PRRT\nPRRT is generally well tolerated, particularly with177Lu, which appeared safer than\nY90 both in terms of haematological/renal toxicity and outcomes. The better tolerance of\n177Lu explains why it has been preferred in many studies.']",4.0,0.8,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1.0,1.0,1.0,45

Appropriate candidates for PRRNT are patients present-\ning with well-differentiated or moderately differentiated neu-\nroendocrine carcinomas, defined as NETs of grade 1 or 2according to the WHO classification of 2010 [ 5]. The inci-\ndence of NETs has been rising over the past 30 years, partic-\nularly those arising from the midgut and pancreas [ 6]. The\nincidence of NETs in the USA rose from 10.9 to 52.4 per\nmillion between 1973 and 2004 (SEER database).

About 72 % of NETs arise in gastrointestinalstructures, 25 % are bronchopulmonary in origin, and less than\n5 % arise at other sites (e.g. thymus, breast and genitourinary\nsystem). Frequently, these tumours are discovered when meta-static or locally advanced and therefore inoperable. NETs can\nbe either functioning or nonfunctioning in nature.

The inci-\ndence of NETs has been rising over the past 30 years, partic-\nularly those arising from the midgut and pancreas [ 6]. The\nincidence of NETs in the USA rose from 10.9 to 52.4 per\nmillion between 1973 and 2004 (SEER database).

8G advanced RAG,Ist der Einsatz von PRRT für den Patienten schädlich?,german,specific,side effects,gpt-4o advanced RAG,"Der Einsatz von PRRT (Peptid-Rezeptor-Radionuklid-Therapie) kann für den Patienten sowohl kurzfristige als auch langfristige Nebenwirkungen haben. Kurzfristige Nebenwirkungen umfassen Übelkeit, Erbrechen, Müdigkeit und Bauchschmerzen, die hauptsächlich durch die gleichzeitige Infusion von Aminosäuren verursacht werden (Camus et al., 2021). Es besteht auch ein geringes Risiko für eine Karzinoid-Krise, die bei etwa 1% der Patienten auftritt (Camus et al., 2021). Hämatotoxische Effekte wie Myelosuppression treten in der Regel vier bis sechs Wochen nach der Infusion auf und sind meist reversibel (Camus et al., 2021).

Langfristige Nebenwirkungen können Nierenversagen und das Auftreten von leukämischen oder myelodysplastischen Syndromen umfassen (Camus et al., 2021). Das Risiko für schwere Nephrotoxizität (Grad 3/4) wurde bei nur 1,5% der Patienten beobachtet (Camus et al., 2021). Fälle von Leukämie und myelodysplastischen Syndromen wurden als Spätfolgen der PRRT-Toxizität mit einer geschätzten Inzidenz von bis zu 2% berichtet (Camus et al., 2021).

Zusammenfassend lässt sich sagen, dass PRRT zwar mit bestimmten Risiken verbunden ist, diese jedoch in der Regel gut beherrschbar sind und die Therapie insgesamt gut vertragen wird.","['PRRT is only applicable for pa-\ntients with a Karnofsky Performance Scale of at least 60 [ 27]. PRRT is contra-indicated\nfor patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding, patients with severe cardiac impairment\n(NYHA III or IV) and those with a life expectancy less than 3 months [ 31]. Since PRRT\ncan induce toxicity, the following pre-treatment laboratory values are required: creatinine\nclearance > 40 mL/min, hemoglobin levels ≥6 mmol/L, leukocytes > 2 ×109/L, platelet\ncount > 75 ×109/L, bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) and aspartate aminotrans-\nferase (ASAT) < 3 times the upper limit of normal and albumin > 3 g/dL [2,3].\n8. PRRT-Related Toxicity\nAdverse events related to PRRT are frequently mild and include nausea, abdominal pain\nand asthenia [ 27,50]. Increased hair loss is observed in up to 60% of patients treated with\n177Lu-DOTATATE, but this is temporary and seldom leads to baldness [ 88]. Besides these\nmild adverse events, PRRT can induce more severe toxicities which can be dose-limiting and\nadjustments to the treatment schedule might be required [ 89]. When the toxicity has subsided\nwithin 16 weeks after the last dose, guidelines advise to administer half of the original activity\nof177Lu-DOTATATE during the next cycle. PRRT should be discontinued when the toxicity\npersists after 16 weeks or recurs after the half dose [ 3]. In the NETTER-1 trial, 7% of the\npatients received a reduced dose because of dose-limiting toxicities [ 27]. The kidneys and the\nbone marrow are the critical organs for dose-limiting toxicities.', 'J. Clin. Med. 2021 ,10, 1267 11 of 15\n4.5.1. Subacute Effects\nPRRT is overall well tolerated with most patients experiencing only moderate toxicity.\nIn the study NETTER-1, validating the PRRT in midgut NETs, 5% of the patients discon-\ntinued treatment due to toxicity related to PRRT. Acute side effects are mainly nausea,\nvomiting, fatigue and abdominal pain. These adverse events are mainly caused by the\nsimultaneous infusion of aminoacids. Particular vigilance must be exercised with regard\nto the risk of carcinoid crisis. This event was reported in a very small minority (1%) of\npatients who received an PRRT treatment. This crisis usually appears within 48 h of the ﬁrst\ninfusion and is related to the massive release of active amines [ 34]. A myelosuppressure\nhas been described and is caused by the irradiation of the bone marrow. Bone marrow\nis particularly radiosensitive, and this toxicity does not appear to be associated to the\nexpression of SSTRs in myeloid cells. Myelosuppression generally develops four at six\nweeks after the infusion, is usually grade 1/2 and is reversible. Hematotoxic effects grade\n3 and 4 have been described in 13% and 10% of the patients receiving90Y-DOTATOC\nand177Lu-DOTATATE, respectively [ 35]. Lymphopenia is the more often reported severe\ncytopenia. Some studies have also reported that PRRT could be safely used in the case\nof diffuse metastatic bone marrow involvement, without irreversible myelosuppression,\nalthough a higher incidence of subacute transient hematologic toxicity was observed [36]\nOther toxicities have been reported, including a risk of hepatotoxicity in the patients\nwith major liver involvement. Thus, as indicated above, it is desirable to consider PRRT\nearly in the management process of the disease.\n4.5.2. Long-Term Effects\nLong-term side effects of PRRT can include renal failure and leukemic or myelodys-\nplastic syndromes.\nThe radiolabels are reabsorbed in the proximal tubules, may accumulate in the proxi-\nmal tubules in the renal interstitium and cause kidney damage. Because of its higher energy\nand longer penetration range,90Y irradiates the renal interstitium glomeruli more exten-\nsively than177Lu. In a large institutional series of 1109 patients treated with90Y-DOTATOC,\n103 patients (9%) were treated with90Y-DOTATOC with severe renal toxicity [ 7]. Nowa-\ndays, the concomitant administration positively charged aminoacids results in a reduction\nof up to 40% of the renal absorption. Despite renal protection, the median decrease of the\ncreatinine clearance is estimated to 4% per year in patients treated with177Lu-DOTATATE.\nThe risk factors for nephrotoxicity cited are diabetes and poorly controlled hypertension.\nRisk of severe nephrotoxicity (grade 3/4) was observed in only 1.5% of patients [ 37]. In\noverall, end-stage renal disease as a consequence of PRRT is extremely rare.\nCases of leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes have been reported as late-onset\nPRRT toxicity, with an estimated incidence of up to 2% [ 37,38]. Age over 70 years, cytopenia\nbefore treatment, the presence of bones metastasis, the high number of previous treatments,\nthe prior use of an alkylating agent and the radiotherapy increases the risk of secondary\nmyelodysplastic syndrome. Brieau et al. reported in a retrospective monocentric study\nconducted in a population of patients treated with PRRT and pre-treatment alkylating\nchemotherapy an increased risk late hematologic toxicity (20%; four patients out of 20) [ 39].\nThe main alkylating agent used in the NET treatment is temozolomide. The development\nof myelodysplastic syndrome or leukemia has been reported between 30 and 70 months\nafter treatment with PRRT [ 39].', 'long-term safety of PRRT in NET. The main organs of concern\nare the bone marrow and the kidney. Transient hematotoxicity,\nparticularly thrombocytopenia, is frequently seen usually around\n4-6 weeks after a treatment cycle but this usually rapidly\nrecovers, allowing a following cycle of treatment. Long-term\nmyelodysplasia or leukaemia appears to occur in a little over 2%\nof patients, although historically, many have been heavily pre-\ntreated. Renal toxicity, which is mitigated with concomitant\namino acid infusion ( 20) has been mainly related to Y-90\ntherapy and is uncommon with Lu-177 ( 28,29).\nThe diagnosis, management and follow-up of patients with\nGEP-NETs is detailed in recent ESMO Guidelines ( 3). PRRT has\nbeen shown to be ben ﬁcial in the management of patients with\nsymptoms of carcinoid syndrome ( 30). ESMO Guidelines\nrecommend the use of Lu-177-DOTATATE following\nsomatostatin analogue therapy, for the treatment of patients\nwith carcinoid syndrome, diarrhea and/or ﬂushing. PRRT is also\nrecommended for patients with GE NETs who have progressive\ndisease following treatment with somatostatin analogues or with\neverolimus and for PNETs following treatment with everolimus,\nsunitinib or chemotherapy (capecitabine and temozolomide/\nstreptozotocin and 5- ﬂuorouracil).\nAlthough PRRT for the treatment of patients with NETs has\nprovided a new paradigm for the management of patients with\nadvanced metastatic disease, the optimal treatment regimen and\nalso the positioning of PRRT in the treatment algorithm remain\nto be de ﬁned. At the present time, patients received a standard\nactivity/dose of treatment at ﬁxed intervals of 8 weeks\n(Lutathera) or 12 weeks (COMPETE study). The currenttreatment regimens are based on empirical observations in the\nclinic. Opportunities for further improving the management of\npatients are expected with new antagonist targeting molecules\nand the application of radionuclides which with different\nphysicochemical properties to Lu-177. A number of clinical\ntrials with PRRT in NETs are currently ongoing ( Table 3 ).The future of targeted radiotherapy in\nNETS\nAt the present time, patients receive a standardized\ntreatment regimen of ~7,5GBq 8-12 weekly for 4 cycles. There\nis a great deal of interest in individualizing patients ’therapy\nregimens based on dosimetry. All patients in the COMPETE\nstudy undergo dosimetric evaluation with 2D planar imaging at\n0,5 hrs, 6 hrs, 24 hrs and 72-96 hrs after the ﬁrst infusion and\nSPECT/CT for hybrid 2D/3D dosimetry at 24 hrs post each\ninfusion. Sub-study A will compare the cumulative absorbed\ndoses to kidneys and target lesions extrapolated from dose 1 to\nthe cumulative absorbed dose from all 4 infusions. In sub-study\nB, the absorbed dose estimated by 3D dosimetry will be\ncompared to estimates from planar 2D and hybrid 2D/3D\ndosimetry. It is expected that the dosimetry data from these\nstudies will facilitate the a pplication of dosimetry to\nindividualized therapy, rather than the standard ‘one size ﬁts\nall’approach.\nThe currently available data for PRRT of NET patients are\nmainly for those with advanced disease, who have receivedprevious therapies. These patients inevitably relapse at some\nstage.

Side effects may be acute, related to the\nadministration of amino acids or to the radiopeptide itself, or\nchronic. The coinfusion of amino acids enlarges the safetymargin for treating with higher activities enabling higher\ntumour radiation doses to be attained safely. Side effects such\nas nausea, headache and rarely vomiting due to metabolicacidosis induced by the amino acid coadministration do occur\nin the majority of patients [ 59,88]. Particular attention and\ncare should be given to avoiding possible electrolyte imbal-ance (hyperkalaemia, hypernatraemia), and the subsequent\nmetabolic acidosis, that might lead to mild nausea and vomit-\ning. The latter side effects should be managed by hydrating thepatient with normal saline and possibly by repeating cortico-\nsteroid or antiemetic administrations.\nPRRNT may exacerbate the syndromes related to the re-\nspective functional tumours, due to the sudden massive re-\nlease of the hormones and receptor stimulation. The clinical\nmanifestation is dependent on the specific hormone involved.The following measures are therefore recommended. Vital\nsigns (at least blood pressure and pulse) should be monitored\nbefore and after radiopeptide infusion, especially in symptom-atic patients. Therapeutic interventions should be undertaken\nto treat the for functional syndrome effects or exacerbation\n(e.g. carcinoid syndrome/hypotension, hypoglycaemia, hyper-gastrinaemia, hypertension, hypotension, WDHA syndrome,\nelectrolyte imbalance) [ 89]. In patients without or with minor\nmetastatic liver involvement, no significant hepatic toxicity\nhas been reported. However, in patients with massive liver\nmetastases and impaired liver function, liver toxicity mayoccur, and this should be considered, along with preexisting\nconditions affecting the liver, when choosing the appropriate\nradioisotope and dosing.

After treatment, patients should avoid\npregnancy for at least 6 months. Due to a temporary impair-ment of fertility, related to a transient damage to Sertoli cells,\nmale patients should consider sperm banking before therapy.\nDelayed side effects\nRenal toxicityThe kidneys are the dose-limiting organs at the activities\nnormally reached with PRRNT. Proper kidney protection, asdiscussed, is currently mandatory. However, despite kidney\nprotection, loss of kidney function can occur after PRRNT,\nwith a creatinine clearance loss of about 3.8 % per year for\n177Lu-DOTATATE and 7.3 % per year for90Y-DOTATOC\n[90].

Clin. Med. 2021 ,10, 1267 2 of 15\n(SSTR). For many years, evidence of an anti-tumor effect of PRRT were only obtained from\nnon-randomized Phase II trials or retrospective studies.

Following these results,177Lu-DOTATATE was approved by\nthe US Food and Drug Administration in 2018 and the European Medicines Agency in 2017\nfor the treatment of gastroenteropancreatic NETs that are well differentiated and obtain a\nprescription authorization in France in metastatic midgut NETs [ 2]. Some interesting data\nexist for pancreatic and pulmonary NETs. In this review, we discuss the clinical efficiency of\nPRRT in gastroenteropancreatic and pulmonary NETs.\n2. Somatostatin Receptors (SSTR) and Radio-Labelled Somatostatin Analogues\nEffect of PRRT is correlated with the ability for the markers to ﬁx the SSTR (SSTR1-5).\nThis therapy is therefore dedicated to NETs who strongly over expressed those receptors.\nSSTRs belong to a family of G-protein coupled receptors with seven transmembrane\ndomains. The majority of well differentiated gastroenteropancreatic and pulmonary NETs\nare characterized by the strong expression of SSTR, including SSTR2 Grade 1/2 NETs\nexpress the SSTR more often and at higher levels than grade 3 NETs. When linked to the\nreceptors, radiolabeled somatostatin analogues are internalized according to the normal\nrecycling dynamics of membrane receptors and the degradation products of peptides\nare stored in lysosomes, in intracellular, which allows for the release and retention of\nradioactivity inside tumor cells [ 3]. This mechanism accounts for the low toxicity of the\nPRRT on the healthy cells. Radiolabelled somatostatin analogs are made up of an isotope\nradionuclide, a carrier molecule (derived from octreotide), and a chelating agent that binds\nthem together and stabilizes the complex. The commonly used chelating agents are DOTA\n(DOTA acid and tetra-azacyclododecane-tetra-acetic) and DTPA (di-ethylenetriamine penta-\naceticacid). Three radionucleides (111In,90Y and177Lu) were conjugated to the somatostatin\nanalogues and their different physical characteristics confer speciﬁc advantages. The90Y\nand177Lu emit beta particles with higher energy and longer ranges, which translates into\ngreater therapeutic potential. Due to the emission of gamma rays, the177Lu can also be\nused for dosimetry and monitoring of tumor response [4].\n3. Modalities of Realization and Patients Selection\nPRRT is the single validated treatment option in the NETs, which for there is a pre-\ndictive marker of answer: the expression of SSTR. Response rates have been shown to\nbe increased in patients with a higher degree of absorption of radiotracers in the case of\n111In-pentetreotid scintigraphy An overall response rate of approximately 60% has been\nreported in patients with a grade 4 according to the Krenning score, corresponding to a tu-\nmor absorption greater than that of the spleen, and kidneys. Intense ﬁxation (SUV) greater\nthan 16 on the68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT is a predictive marker of high tumor response\n(sensitivity: 95%; specﬁcity: 60 %) [ 5] (Figure 1). The effectiveness of PRRT is correlated\nwith the tumor volume and the location of the primary tumor (amount of SSTR present\non the tumor cell) (Figure 2). Thus, NETs with high liver tumor volume are considered\nto be less sensitive to PRRT [ 6]. Similarly, it is suggested that pancreatic NETs frequently\nrespond to the PRRT but with an earlier progression than in midgut NETs.

Nephrotoxicity may be aggravated by risk factors,such as preexisting hypertension or diabetes mellitus [ 57]. To\ncounteract and reduce the high kidney retention of radiopep-\ntides, positively charged amino acids, such as\nL-lysine and/or\nL-arginine, are coinfused to competitively inhibit the proximal\ntubular reabsorption of the radiopeptide. The coadministration\nof these amino acids leads to a significant reduction in the\nrenal absorbed dose, which ranges from 9 % to 53 % [ 58].\nRenal absorbed dose is further reduced by up to 39 % byextending the infusion time of the amino acid solution over\n10 h, and up to 65 % by extending the protection over 2 days\nfollowing radiopeptide administration, thereby covering therenal elimination phase more efficiently [ 59,60].\nAmino acid protection protocols\nLysine and/or arginine should be diluted appropriately in\nlarge volumes of normal saline in order to hydrate thepatient, unless the patient suffers from cardiac insufficiency\n(e.g. carcinoid heart valve disease), in which case volume\noverload, possibly leading to acute exacerbation of the con-dition, should be avoided.

The NETTER-1 trial\ndemonstrated prolonged progression-free survival in midgut NET\npatients treated with 4 cycles of177Lu-DOTATATE, which subse-\nquently led to the approval of this therapy ( 4).\nTREATMENT OVERVIEW\n177Lu-DOTATATE is administered at an activity of 7.4 GBq\n(200 mCi) every 8 61 wk for 4 cycles. Combined with prophy-\nlactic amino acid infusions and antiemetics, each treatment visit\ncan last approximately 5–8 h ( Fig. 1). Before starting PRRT treat-\nments, each treatment site must ensure that177Lu is included in their\ninstitutional radioactive materials license. A detailed review of pro-\ncedures surrounding177Lu-DOTATATE therapy is provided below.\nPATIENT SCREENING\nPatients should be evaluated by a multidisciplinary NET team,\nincluding a cancer specialist with expertise in the medical man-\nagement of NETs as well as a nuclear medicine physician or\nappropriate authorized user to decide on the appropriateness and\ntiming of PRRT in individual patients. Potential candidates should\nundergo an SSTR PET scan or SSTR scintigraphy (111In-pentetreotide)\nto demonstrate adequate SSTR expression ( 2). Traditionally, SSTR\nexpression on111In-pentetreotide greater than background hepatic\nuptake has been considered an eligibility requirement for PRRT\n(5). Necessary levels of SSTR expression on68Ga-based SSTR\nPET have not been clearly deﬁned, but lesion uptake should ex-\nceed background hepatic uptake. Laboratory values should be\nchecked shortly before the treatment is ordered (typically 2 wk\nbefore each cycle). These should include blood urea nitrogen,\ncreatinine, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotrans-\nferase, alanine aminotransferase, total bilirubin, white blood cell\nwith differential, hemoglobin, and platelet counts. The threshold\nvalues provided in Table 1 should be taken as general eligibility\nguidelines for therapy.SOMATOSTATIN ANALOG THERAPY\nSSA therapy is used frequently to treat NET patients, and SSAs\nare typically administered in depot formulations every 4 wk. It is\nrecommended that PRRT treatments be scheduled at least 4 wk\nafter the last long-acting SSA therapy to prevent interference with\nSSTR binding. For symptomatic patients, short-acting SSAs being\nused as a bridge should be stopped at least 24 h before treatment.\nSubsequent SSA doses can be administered as soon as several hours\nafter the completion of the radiopharmaceutical therapy. During and\nafter completion of PRRT, it is generally agreed that syndromic\npatients should remain on SSA therapy. It is unclear whether patients\nwith nonfunctional tumors should remain on SSA treatment regard-\nless of whether or not they had progressed on SSA therapy before\ninitiation of PRRT. In the NETTER-1 study, all patients remained\non long-acting release octreotide despite prior progression on this\ndrug, and the177Lu-DOTATATE package insert suggests that patients\nshould remain on SSAs for up to 18 mo after treatment ( 6). How-\never, there are no clear data to support or refute this recommendation.\nTREATMENT LOCATION\nSites have the option to provide PRRT in an inpatient or out-\npatient setting, within the oncology infusion clinic or nuclear med-\nicine department, or a combination of both locations. Most sites in\nthe United States treat in the outpatient setting.']",3.0,0.6666666666666666,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1.0,1.0,1.0,54

If\ninpatient therapy is required by national legislation, the\ntreatment should take place in an approved facility. Thefacility must have appropriate personnel, radiation safety\nequipment, and procedures for waste management and han-\ndling accidental contamination of the site or personnel.\n90Y-DOTATOC or177Lu-DOTATATE should be admin-\nistered by appropriately trained medical staff with support-\ning nursing staff with a medical physics expert available.\nPhysicians responsible for treating patients should have a\ngeneral knowledge of the pathophysiology and natural historyof the respective diseases, should be familiar with alternative\nforms of therapy, and should be able to closely liaise with\nother physicians involved in managing the patients. Cliniciansinvolved in the utilization of unsealed radionuclide sources for\ntherapy must also be knowledgeable about and compliant with\napplicable national legislation and local regulations.Patient preparation\nRenal protectionTogether with the bone marrow, the kidneys are the critical\norgans in PRRNT particularly when using\n90Y-DOTATOC.\nProximal tubular reabsorption of the radiopeptide and subse-\nquent retention in the interstitium result in excessive renal\nirradiation. Nephrotoxicity may be aggravated by risk factors,such as preexisting hypertension or diabetes mellitus [ 57]. To\ncounteract and reduce the high kidney retention of radiopep-\ntides, positively charged amino acids, such as\nL-lysine and/or\nL-arginine, are coinfused to competitively inhibit the proximal\ntubular reabsorption of the radiopeptide. The coadministration\nof these amino acids leads to a significant reduction in the\nrenal absorbed dose, which ranges from 9 % to 53 % [ 58].\nRenal absorbed dose is further reduced by up to 39 % byextending the infusion time of the amino acid solution over\n10 h, and up to 65 % by extending the protection over 2 days\nfollowing radiopeptide administration, thereby covering therenal elimination phase more efficiently [ 59,60].\nAmino acid protection protocols\nLysine and/or arginine should be diluted appropriately in\nlarge volumes of normal saline in order to hydrate thepatient, unless the patient suffers from cardiac insufficiency\n(e.g. carcinoid heart valve disease), in which case volume\noverload, possibly leading to acute exacerbation of the con-dition, should be avoided. Hyperosmotic solutions in partic-\nular should be avoided since they can induce dangerous\nelectrolyte imbalances that might lead to severe metabolicacidosis and cardiac arrhythmias. An appropriate dilution is\n25 g of amino acid in 1 l of normal saline.\nBefore beginning the amino acid infusion, appropriate\nmeasures against nausea and vomiting should be undertaken\nby administering an antiemetic (e.g. 5-HT3 antagonist, such as\ngranisetron) and/or a corticosteroid (e.g.', 'During and\nafter completion of PRRT, it is generally agreed that syndromic\npatients should remain on SSA therapy.

Most sites in\nthe United States treat in the outpatient setting. Oncology nursing\nstaff are often more accustomed to the complexities of required\nconcomitant medication infusions and patient monitoring than\nnuclear medicine staff, but nuclear medicine staff are well\ntrained in radiation safety and the necessary precautions required\nduring administration of radioa ctivity. If a combination approach\nis taken (i.e., the patient is transported between departments for\nspeciﬁc components of the proced ure), extra caution regarding\nradiation protection is require d for patient travel. When treated\nas an outpatient, a patient should be forewarned of the uncommon\npossibility of an overnight hospital stay should a complication such\nas a neuroendocrine hormonal crisis or severe emesis occur ( 6).\nROOM PREPARATION\nBecause body ﬂuids (primarily urine) are radioactive after177Lu-\nDOTATATE administration, room preparation is essential to reduce\npotential contamination.

At patient discharge, the radiation exposure should be\nmeasured and patients should receive tailored advice on the duration of radiation safety\nprecautions at home, to avoid a high radiation exposure to other people, particularly children\nand pregnant women. Patients with NET-associated hormonal syndromes who have an\nindication for continuation of SSA use should adjust the moment of the injections to the\nPRRT cycles. Long-acting SSA should not be given within 4–6 weeks before a cycle of PRRT\nbecause of interference with the radiolabeled SSA. Although there is conflicting evidence\nfrom two limited single center studies whether continuation of SSA treatment is beneficial in\nnon-functioning NETs [ 63,64], this practice is often adopted. If the patient suffers from severe\nhormonal symptoms, short-acting SSA can be used to bridge this period up till 24 h before\nPRRT. Radiopharmaceuticals such as177Lu-DOTATATE need to be administered at specialized\nfacilities by medical personnel trained in radiation safety. These facilities should adhere to\nnational and international regulations on the use of radiopharmaceuticals and be licensed by\nthe regulatory authorities. Depending on local protocol and exposure regulations, PRRT with\n177Lu-DOTATATE can be given in an in-patient as well as an out-patient setting. In between\ncycles, patients should be reviewed for adverse effects, including full blood count and renal\nand liver function. Response evaluation by cross-sectional imaging is usually performed 2–3\nand 6 months after the last cycle of PRRT. Long-term follow-up is determined on an individual\nbasis taking into account the tumor biology and therapeutic response [ 65]. Pseudo-progression\nis a phenomenon that should be considered in the response evaluation when an increase in\ntumor size is seen during or short after treatment with PRRT. Pseudo-progression is probably\nbased on localized, temporarily edema caused by inflammation as a response to PRRT and\ndoes not show the actual tumor response to the therapy [ 58]. When pseudo-progression is\nsuspected, functional imaging (for example, PET/CT) can help differentiate between true\nprogression and pseudo-progression [31].\n5. Salvage PRRT\nIn NET patients who showed tumor response at least 18 months after the first cycle of\n177Lu-DOTATATE, re-treatment with PRRT (R-PRRT) with two additional cycles of 7.4 GBq\neach after renewed PD has shown antitumoral effects. In a meta-analysis on the effect of\nR-PRRT, the pooled median PFS was 14 months with a pooled median OS of 27 months.\nSimilarly, the pooled ORR was 17% with a disease control rate of 77%. Response rates,\nPFS and OS were lower than for initial PRRT [ 66], nonetheless R-PRRT remains a potential\noption for GEP-NET patients when other systemic treatment options are limited. The limited\nefficacy of R-PRRT as compared to initial PRRT might be explained by the administration\nof lower cumulative activity (i.e., generally half of the initial PRRT dosage) [ 51], the increase\nin tumor bulk at baseline before R-PRRT and potential changes in the tumor biology, such\nas a longitudinal increase in Ki-67. In the largest study to date by van der Zwan et al., no\ndifference in toxicity after R-PRRT as compared with initial PRRT was observed, particularly\nno increased occurrence of nephrotoxicity or significant hematological disease [ 67]. In cases\nwhere R-PRRT has provided additional benefit on tumor response and prolonged PFS, further\nre-treatment at the time of progression can be considered [67].\n6.

Thefacility must have appropriate personnel, radiation safety\nequipment, and procedures for waste management and han-\ndling accidental contamination of the site or personnel.\n90Y-DOTATOC or177Lu-DOTATATE should be admin-\nistered by appropriately trained medical staff with support-\ning nursing staff with a medical physics expert available.\nPhysicians responsible for treating patients should have a\ngeneral knowledge of the pathophysiology and natural historyof the respective diseases, should be familiar with alternative\nforms of therapy, and should be able to closely liaise with\nother physicians involved in managing the patients. Cliniciansinvolved in the utilization of unsealed radionuclide sources for\ntherapy must also be knowledgeable about and compliant with\napplicable national legislation and local regulations.Patient preparation\nRenal protectionTogether with the bone marrow, the kidneys are the critical\norgans in PRRNT particularly when using\n90Y-DOTATOC.\nProximal tubular reabsorption of the radiopeptide and subse-\nquent retention in the interstitium result in excessive renal\nirradiation. Nephrotoxicity may be aggravated by risk factors,such as preexisting hypertension or diabetes mellitus [ 57]. To\ncounteract and reduce the high kidney retention of radiopep-\ntides, positively charged amino acids, such as\nL-lysine and/or\nL-arginine, are coinfused to competitively inhibit the proximal\ntubular reabsorption of the radiopeptide. The coadministration\nof these amino acids leads to a significant reduction in the\nrenal absorbed dose, which ranges from 9 % to 53 % [ 58].\nRenal absorbed dose is further reduced by up to 39 % byextending the infusion time of the amino acid solution over\n10 h, and up to 65 % by extending the protection over 2 days\nfollowing radiopeptide administration, thereby covering therenal elimination phase more efficiently [ 59,60].\nAmino acid protection protocols\nLysine and/or arginine should be diluted appropriately in\nlarge volumes of normal saline in order to hydrate thepatient, unless the patient suffers from cardiac insufficiency\n(e.g. carcinoid heart valve disease), in which case volume\noverload, possibly leading to acute exacerbation of the con-dition, should be avoided. Hyperosmotic solutions in partic-\nular should be avoided since they can induce dangerous\nelectrolyte imbalances that might lead to severe metabolicacidosis and cardiac arrhythmias. An appropriate dilution is\n25 g of amino acid in 1 l of normal saline.\nBefore beginning the amino acid infusion, appropriate\nmeasures against nausea and vomiting should be undertaken\nby administering an antiemetic (e.g. 5-HT3 antagonist, such as\ngranisetron) and/or a corticosteroid (e.g.', 'During and\nafter completion of PRRT, it is generally agreed that syndromic\npatients should remain on SSA therapy. It is unclear whether patients\nwith nonfunctional tumors should remain on SSA treatment regard-\nless of whether or not they had progressed on SSA therapy before\ninitiation of PRRT. In the NETTER-1 study, all patients remained\non long-acting release octreotide despite prior progression on this\ndrug, and the177Lu-DOTATATE package insert suggests that patients\nshould remain on SSAs for up to 18 mo after treatment ( 6). How-\never, there are no clear data to support or refute this recommendation.\nTREATMENT LOCATION\nSites have the option to provide PRRT in an inpatient or out-\npatient setting, within the oncology infusion clinic or nuclear med-\nicine department, or a combination of both locations. Most sites in\nthe United States treat in the outpatient setting. Oncology nursing\nstaff are often more accustomed to the complexities of required\nconcomitant medication infusions and patient monitoring than\nnuclear medicine staff, but nuclear medicine staff are well\ntrained in radiation safety and the necessary precautions required\nduring administration of radioa ctivity. If a combination approach\nis taken (i.e., the patient is transported between departments for\nspeciﬁc components of the proced ure), extra caution regarding\nradiation protection is require d for patient travel. When treated\nas an outpatient, a patient should be forewarned of the uncommon\npossibility of an overnight hospital stay should a complication such\nas a neuroendocrine hormonal crisis or severe emesis occur ( 6).\nROOM PREPARATION\nBecause body ﬂuids (primarily urine) are radioactive after177Lu-\nDOTATATE administration, room preparation is essential to reduce\npotential contamination. For example, patient stretchers, chairs,\nﬂoors, and lower walls can be covered with a prophylactic protective\ncovering ( Fig. 2). Furthermore, whereas a treatment suite with an\nFIGURE 1.

At patient discharge, the radiation exposure should be\nmeasured and patients should receive tailored advice on the duration of radiation safety\nprecautions at home, to avoid a high radiation exposure to other people, particularly children\nand pregnant women. Patients with NET-associated hormonal syndromes who have an\nindication for continuation of SSA use should adjust the moment of the injections to the\nPRRT cycles. Long-acting SSA should not be given within 4–6 weeks before a cycle of PRRT\nbecause of interference with the radiolabeled SSA. Although there is conflicting evidence\nfrom two limited single center studies whether continuation of SSA treatment is beneficial in\nnon-functioning NETs [ 63,64], this practice is often adopted. If the patient suffers from severe\nhormonal symptoms, short-acting SSA can be used to bridge this period up till 24 h before\nPRRT. Radiopharmaceuticals such as177Lu-DOTATATE need to be administered at specialized\nfacilities by medical personnel trained in radiation safety. These facilities should adhere to\nnational and international regulations on the use of radiopharmaceuticals and be licensed by\nthe regulatory authorities. Depending on local protocol and exposure regulations, PRRT with\n177Lu-DOTATATE can be given in an in-patient as well as an out-patient setting. In between\ncycles, patients should be reviewed for adverse effects, including full blood count and renal\nand liver function. Response evaluation by cross-sectional imaging is usually performed 2–3\nand 6 months after the last cycle of PRRT. Long-term follow-up is determined on an individual\nbasis taking into account the tumor biology and therapeutic response [ 65]. Pseudo-progression\nis a phenomenon that should be considered in the response evaluation when an increase in\ntumor size is seen during or short after treatment with PRRT. Pseudo-progression is probably\nbased on localized, temporarily edema caused by inflammation as a response to PRRT and\ndoes not show the actual tumor response to the therapy [ 58]. When pseudo-progression is\nsuspected, functional imaging (for example, PET/CT) can help differentiate between true\nprogression and pseudo-progression [31].\n5. Salvage PRRT\nIn NET patients who showed tumor response at least 18 months after the first cycle of\n177Lu-DOTATATE, re-treatment with PRRT (R-PRRT) with two additional cycles of 7.4 GBq\neach after renewed PD has shown antitumoral effects. In a meta-analysis on the effect of\nR-PRRT, the pooled median PFS was 14 months with a pooled median OS of 27 months.\nSimilarly, the pooled ORR was 17% with a disease control rate of 77%. Response rates,\nPFS and OS were lower than for initial PRRT [ 66], nonetheless R-PRRT remains a potential\noption for GEP-NET patients when other systemic treatment options are limited. The limited\nefficacy of R-PRRT as compared to initial PRRT might be explained by the administration\nof lower cumulative activity (i.e., generally half of the initial PRRT dosage) [ 51], the increase\nin tumor bulk at baseline before R-PRRT and potential changes in the tumor biology, such\nas a longitudinal increase in Ki-67. In the largest study to date by van der Zwan et al., no\ndifference in toxicity after R-PRRT as compared with initial PRRT was observed, particularly\nno increased occurrence of nephrotoxicity or significant hematological disease [ 67]. In cases\nwhere R-PRRT has provided additional benefit on tumor response and prolonged PFS, further\nre-treatment at the time of progression can be considered [67].\n6.

Clin. Med. 2021 ,10, 1267 11 of 15\n4.5.1. Subacute Effects\nPRRT is overall well tolerated with most patients experiencing only moderate toxicity.\nIn the study NETTER-1, validating the PRRT in midgut NETs, 5% of the patients discon-\ntinued treatment due to toxicity related to PRRT. Acute side effects are mainly nausea,\nvomiting, fatigue and abdominal pain. These adverse events are mainly caused by the\nsimultaneous infusion of aminoacids. Particular vigilance must be exercised with regard\nto the risk of carcinoid crisis. This event was reported in a very small minority (1%) of\npatients who received an PRRT treatment. This crisis usually appears within 48 h of the ﬁrst\ninfusion and is related to the massive release of active amines [ 34]. A myelosuppressure\nhas been described and is caused by the irradiation of the bone marrow. Bone marrow\nis particularly radiosensitive, and this toxicity does not appear to be associated to the\nexpression of SSTRs in myeloid cells. Myelosuppression generally develops four at six\nweeks after the infusion, is usually grade 1/2 and is reversible. Hematotoxic effects grade\n3 and 4 have been described in 13% and 10% of the patients receiving90Y-DOTATOC\nand177Lu-DOTATATE, respectively [ 35]. Lymphopenia is the more often reported severe\ncytopenia. Some studies have also reported that PRRT could be safely used in the case\nof diffuse metastatic bone marrow involvement, without irreversible myelosuppression,\nalthough a higher incidence of subacute transient hematologic toxicity was observed [36]\nOther toxicities have been reported, including a risk of hepatotoxicity in the patients\nwith major liver involvement. Thus, as indicated above, it is desirable to consider PRRT\nearly in the management process of the disease.\n4.5.2. Long-Term Effects\nLong-term side effects of PRRT can include renal failure and leukemic or myelodys-\nplastic syndromes.\nThe radiolabels are reabsorbed in the proximal tubules, may accumulate in the proxi-\nmal tubules in the renal interstitium and cause kidney damage. Because of its higher energy\nand longer penetration range,90Y irradiates the renal interstitium glomeruli more exten-\nsively than177Lu. In a large institutional series of 1109 patients treated with90Y-DOTATOC,\n103 patients (9%) were treated with90Y-DOTATOC with severe renal toxicity [ 7]. Nowa-\ndays, the concomitant administration positively charged aminoacids results in a reduction\nof up to 40% of the renal absorption. Despite renal protection, the median decrease of the\ncreatinine clearance is estimated to 4% per year in patients treated with177Lu-DOTATATE.\nThe risk factors for nephrotoxicity cited are diabetes and poorly controlled hypertension.\nRisk of severe nephrotoxicity (grade 3/4) was observed in only 1.5% of patients [ 37]. In\noverall, end-stage renal disease as a consequence of PRRT is extremely rare.\nCases of leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes have been reported as late-onset\nPRRT toxicity, with an estimated incidence of up to 2% [ 37,38]. Age over 70 years, cytopenia\nbefore treatment, the presence of bones metastasis, the high number of previous treatments,\nthe prior use of an alkylating agent and the radiotherapy increases the risk of secondary\nmyelodysplastic syndrome. Brieau et al. reported in a retrospective monocentric study\nconducted in a population of patients treated with PRRT and pre-treatment alkylating\nchemotherapy an increased risk late hematologic toxicity (20%; four patients out of 20) [ 39].\nThe main alkylating agent used in the NET treatment is temozolomide. The development\nof myelodysplastic syndrome or leukemia has been reported between 30 and 70 months\nafter treatment with PRRT [ 39].', 'during the first courses of therapy following the injection of\n177Lu-DOTATATE.\nSide effects\nAcute\nSide effects of PRRNT are usually mild, if necessary precau-\ntions are taken. Side effects may be acute, related to the\nadministration of amino acids or to the radiopeptide itself, or\nchronic. The coinfusion of amino acids enlarges the safetymargin for treating with higher activities enabling higher\ntumour radiation doses to be attained safely. Side effects such\nas nausea, headache and rarely vomiting due to metabolicacidosis induced by the amino acid coadministration do occur\nin the majority of patients [ 59,88]. Particular attention and\ncare should be given to avoiding possible electrolyte imbal-ance (hyperkalaemia, hypernatraemia), and the subsequent\nmetabolic acidosis, that might lead to mild nausea and vomit-\ning. The latter side effects should be managed by hydrating thepatient with normal saline and possibly by repeating cortico-\nsteroid or antiemetic administrations.\nPRRNT may exacerbate the syndromes related to the re-\nspective functional tumours, due to the sudden massive re-\nlease of the hormones and receptor stimulation. The clinical\nmanifestation is dependent on the specific hormone involved.The following measures are therefore recommended. Vital\nsigns (at least blood pressure and pulse) should be monitored\nbefore and after radiopeptide infusion, especially in symptom-atic patients. Therapeutic interventions should be undertaken\nto treat the for functional syndrome effects or exacerbation\n(e.g. carcinoid syndrome/hypotension, hypoglycaemia, hyper-gastrinaemia, hypertension, hypotension, WDHA syndrome,\nelectrolyte imbalance) [ 89]. In patients without or with minor\nmetastatic liver involvement, no significant hepatic toxicity\nhas been reported. However, in patients with massive liver\nmetastases and impaired liver function, liver toxicity mayoccur, and this should be considered, along with preexisting\nconditions affecting the liver, when choosing the appropriate\nradioisotope and dosing.

After treatment, patients should avoid\npregnancy for at least 6 months. Due to a temporary impair-ment of fertility, related to a transient damage to Sertoli cells,\nmale patients should consider sperm banking before therapy.\nDelayed side effects\nRenal toxicityThe kidneys are the dose-limiting organs at the activities\nnormally reached with PRRNT. Proper kidney protection, asdiscussed, is currently mandatory. However, despite kidney\nprotection, loss of kidney function can occur after PRRNT,\nwith a creatinine clearance loss of about 3.8 % per year for\n177Lu-DOTATATE and 7.3 % per year for90Y-DOTATOC\n[90]. In a series of 1,109 patients treated with90Y-DOTATOC,\nthe incidence of grade 4 and 5 kidney toxicity was found to be9.2 % [ 50]. Delayed renal toxicity following\n90Y-DOTATOC\ntreatment was observed more frequently in patients with pre-\ndisposing risk factors including longstanding and poorly con-trolled hypertension and diabetes mellitus [ 56].\nBone marrow toxicitySevere (grade 3 and 4), mostly reversible, acute bone mar-\nrow toxicity is observed in less than 10 –13 % of treatment\ncycles with\n90Y-DOTATOC, and in 2 –3 % of cycles with\n177Lu-DOTATATE. Nevertheless, sporadic cases of myelo-\ndysplastic syndrome or overt acute myelogenous leukaemiahave been reported [ 45,49,50].\nEndocrine systemsDespite the presence of sstr in normal pituitary, thyroid and\nadrenal glands and Langerhans cells, no significant alterationin endocrine hormone function have been reported [ 91].\nResults\nPRRNT with the somatostatin analogues\n90Y-DOTATOC\nand177Lu-DOTATATE has been explored in NET for more\nthan a decade.', 'PRRT is only applicable for pa-\ntients with a Karnofsky Performance Scale of at least 60 [ 27]. PRRT is contra-indicated\nfor patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding, patients with severe cardiac impairment\n(NYHA III or IV) and those with a life expectancy less than 3 months [ 31]. Since PRRT\ncan induce toxicity, the following pre-treatment laboratory values are required: creatinine\nclearance > 40 mL/min, hemoglobin levels ≥6 mmol/L, leukocytes > 2 ×109/L, platelet\ncount > 75 ×109/L, bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) and aspartate aminotrans-\nferase (ASAT) < 3 times the upper limit of normal and albumin > 3 g/dL [2,3].\n8. PRRT-Related Toxicity\nAdverse events related to PRRT are frequently mild and include nausea, abdominal pain\nand asthenia [ 27,50]. Increased hair loss is observed in up to 60% of patients treated with\n177Lu-DOTATATE, but this is temporary and seldom leads to baldness [ 88]. Besides these\nmild adverse events, PRRT can induce more severe toxicities which can be dose-limiting and\nadjustments to the treatment schedule might be required [ 89]. When the toxicity has subsided\nwithin 16 weeks after the last dose, guidelines advise to administer half of the original activity\nof177Lu-DOTATATE during the next cycle. PRRT should be discontinued when the toxicity\npersists after 16 weeks or recurs after the half dose [ 3]. In the NETTER-1 trial, 7% of the\npatients received a reduced dose because of dose-limiting toxicities [ 27]. The kidneys and the\nbone marrow are the critical organs for dose-limiting toxicities.']",4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1.0,1.0,1.0,51

Retreatment with\nextra cycles of PRRT as salvage therapy may be consideredwhen better options are not available. One study showed that\nsalvage therapy with two additional cycles of\n177Lu-octreotate\ndoes not lead to serious hematologic or nephrotoxic side ef-\nfects, but the tumor response rate was less compared with\ninitial treatment [ 50].\nAnother report showed that long PFS after the initial treat-\nment with PRRT predicts a prolonged PFS after salvage ther-apy [ 51], and argued that PRRT with\n177Lu-octreotate in the\nretreatment setting is a safe and effective option in patients\nwith metastatic GEP-NETs. For these reasons, retreatment\nseems a good option for patients who responded well after\nthe initial cycles of PRRT [ 52]. This novel and important\nconcept of salvage therapy of NET needs to be tested in large,\nprospective, and multi-center trials to contribute to evidence-\nbased findings.\nTreatment Side Effects\nPRRT is generally well-tolerated. Side effects can be divided to\nacute, subacute, and long-term side effects, as summarized inTable 4. Acute side effects are usually mild and self-limiting.\nNausea or vomiting are related to the concomitant admin-\nistration of kidney-protective amino acids. Subacute side\neffects are related to the radiopeptide itself, such as bonemarrow suppression, mild hair loss (observed with\n177Lu-\noctreotate), or, more rarely, an exacerbation of a clinicalsyndrome. The most common subacute side effect ofPRRT, occurring within 4 to 6 weeks after therapy, is bone\nmarrow suppression. Usually, the hematologic toxicity is\nmild and reversible. More serious WHO grade 3 or 4 tox-icity may occur, but this has been seen in less than 15% of\npatients [ 53].\nLong-term side effects of PRRT may include renal failure\nas well as leukemia/myelody splastic syndromes (MDS).\nBecause radiopeptides are usually reabsorbed in the proximal\ntubules, they can accumulate in the renal interstitium and in-duce inflammation and fibrosis with eventual kidney damage.\nCo-administration of positively charged amino acids results ina reduction of renal radioactive uptake, up to 40% as reportedin some studies [ 16,54]. If patients have long-standing or\npoorly controlled comorbidities such as diabetes and hyper-\ntension that affect kidney function, it is expected that there\nwould be a larger and more persistent decline in creatinine\nclearance [ 55].\nAdministration of Treatment\nFor purposes of kidney protection, positively charged amino\nacids, such as L-lysine and/or L-arginine, are co-infused to\ncompetitively inhibit the proximal tubular reabsorption ofthe radiopeptide [ 56]. This reduces the renal-absorbed dose.\nDilution of the amino acids with saline allows proper hydra-tion for the patient, an appropriate ratio to use is 25 g of aminoacid in 1 L of normal saline. Obviously, patients ’comorbidi-\nties should be taken into account (e.g., avoid volume overloadin patients with cardiac insufficiency and take care in avoidingelectrolyte imbalances with hyperosmotic solutions).\nAntiemetics can be administered before the infusion to avoidpotential nausea or vomiting. Amino acid infusion should bestarted 30 –60 min before administration of the radiopeptide\nand should be maintained over 4 h. Several amino acid pro-tective schemes have been proposed in the joint IAEA,EANM, and SNMMI practical guidelines on PRRT treatment\nof NETs [ 56].\nCurrent administration schedules comprise the most ap-\npropriate number of cycles (generally four or five) and thebest delivery frequency (8 weeks apart). This pattern allows\nthe patient to recover from the mild side effects of the ther-apy and increases its effectiveness in terms of the radiobi-\nological activity [ 57]. Radioisotope infusion should be\naround 30 min as recommended in the literature.']",4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1.0,0.0,0.5,78

Symptom Control\nPRRT is not only effective in reducing tumor growth, but it can also lead to symp-\ntomatic improvement in NET patients, including associated hormonal syndromes [37]. In\nthe NETTER-1 trial, PRRT with177Lu-DOTATATE provided a signiﬁcant beneﬁt in quality\nof life (QoL) compared to octreotide LAR. Time to deterioration (TTD) was signiﬁcantly\nlonger in the177Lu-DOTATATE group, with positive outcomes in the domains of global\nhealth, physical functioning, diarrhea, pain, body image, disease-related worries and\nfatigue [ 38]. In a prospective series of 265 GEP- and bronchial NET patients, QoL, perfor-\nmance status and symptoms (particularly insomnia, appetite loss and diarrhea) improved\nsigniﬁcantly after PRRT [ 39]. Importantly, QoL in asymptomatic NET patients did not\ndecline during therapy. In a single center study of 144 patients, a symptomatic response to\nPRRT with regard to diarrhea, abdominal pain, ﬂushing and fatigue was observed in 70%,\n63%, 64% and 53%, respectively [ 33]. Results are summarized in Table 1. In patients with a\nfunctioning NET, PRRT has shown to be an effective treatment regarding symptom control\nand circulating hormone levels [ 40,41]. Carcinoid syndrome (CS) is the most prevalent\nhormonal NET syndrome and is caused by excretion of hormones and amines such as\nserotonin, histamine, catecholamines, prostaglandins and tachykinins. In a study involving\n22 patients with refractory CS who received PRRT for symptomatic control, ﬂushing and\nbowel movement frequency improved signiﬁcantly [ 42]. Two-thirds of the patients who\nhad at least two episodes of ﬂushing per day had a minimal decrease of 50% of these\nepisodes. Of patients with bowel movement frequency of at least four times a day, 47%\nexperienced > 30% decrease, while 29% experienced > 50% decrease [ 37]. In a systematic\nreview, symptomatic improvement after PRRT was observed in 74% of patients with diar-\nrhea and in 6% of patients with ﬂushing [ 43]. Together, these results have positioned PRRT\nwith177Lu-DOTATATE as a viable option for refractory CS [ 44]. In addition, case reports\nhave shown improvement of symptoms and echocardiographic parameters of carcinoid\nheart disease after PRRT, which is a severe symptom of CS [ 45]. Similar positive effects of\nPRRT on hormonal levels and symptoms have been observed in patients with functioning\npanNET syndromes, such as insulinoma, gastrinoma, glucagonoma and VIPoma [40].\nTable 1.

Due to\nthe retrospective nature of these studies, the results required conﬁrmation in prospective\ntrials. According to PanNET guidelines, PRRT should even be used as a third-line therapy\nin patients with advanced locoregional disease following the failure of SSAs, everolimus,\nand/or cytotoxic chemotherapy [ 8]. Two cases were presented for third-line therapy, in\nwhich patients with metastatic PanNET (G2 Ki-67 10%) received chemotherapy or PRRT\naccording to the standard of care following SSA failure. After six cycles of STZ/5-FU (over\nnine months), the patient progressed four months later without treatment. The majority of\nparticipants preferred PRRT (38.6%, n = 32) over STZ/5-FU reinduction (26.5%, n = 22) [ 136].\nIn patients with GEP-NET G1 and G2, 177Lu-PRRT was compared to the mTOR inhibitor\neverolimus. Despite the success of 177Lu-DOTATATE PRRT, not all patients showed bene-\nﬁts, and patients typically relapsed 2–3 years after initiating treatment. As a result, various\nexperimental approaches and strategies are being investigated in order to maximize PRRT’s\neffectiveness while minimizing potential side effects [ 8]. The NETTER-1 phase III study\ndemonstrated that, in addition to improving progression-free survival, 177Lu-Dotatate\nsigniﬁcantly improves patient quality of life signiﬁcantly when compared to high-dose\noctreotide [ 137]. In the study where 229 patients randomly received Lu-DOTATATE every\neight weeks for four cycles plus 30 mg octreotide every four weeks or high-dose octreotide\n(60 mg) every four weeks alone showed a signiﬁcant reduction in tumour progression or\ndeath in the Lu-DOTATATE treatment group. According to recent investigations, the time\nto quality of life decline was substantially longer in the 177Lu-DOTATATE therapy group.\nAfter the NETTER-1 phase III trial, the 177Lu-DOTATATE treatment was approved for\nthe somatostatin receptor-positive GEP-NETs [ 138]. To begin, treatment may be continued\nafter four cycles of PRRT, depending on kidney and bone marrow tolerance, for example,\nwith a reduced radioactivity as part of the salvage therapy (Re-PRRT). Retreatment with\n177Lu-DOTATATE-based PRRT showed an optimistic survival beneﬁt with acceptable\nsafety in patients with NETs [ 139]. The administration of PRRT intra-arterially into the\nhepatic artery rather than intravenously may increase the tumour-absorbed dose in liver\nmetastases. However, intra-arterial administration is not mentioned in guidelines and is\nconsidered experimental [ 140]. Patients with hepatic dominant metastases, in particular,\nwould beneﬁt from this approach due to the increased uptake of the radiopharmaceutical\n(the so-called “ﬁrst-pass” effect). In a neoadjuvant setting, the PRRT is becoming increas-\ningly important. PRRT was associated with a signiﬁcant reduction in tumour size and the\ntumour was rendered operable in patients with inoperable PanNETs and distant (metastatic)\ndisease. In such instances, a complete response was possible [ 8]. PRRT was likely to be\nthe best treatment option in patients with advanced well-differentiated NETs in terms\nof the beneﬁt–risk ratio. Numerous nonrandomized studies of PRRT have consistently\ndemonstrated high response rates and prolonged PFS in patients with GEP-NETs. In a more\nrecent randomized phase III trial, PRRT plus the best supportive care provided a longer PFS\nthan high-dose octreotide, and did so with limited serious adverse events (SAEs) in patients\nwith advanced midgut NETs.', 'prolonged for 22,7 months in the ¹ ⁷⁷Lu-DOTATATE group.\nThis included improvement in daily activities, role functioning\n(participation in employment and leisure). Furthermore,\npatients also demonstrated improvements in diarrhea (48%),\nfatigue (50%), treatment scale and body image (63%) endocrine\nscale (61%) and GI scale (60%) ( 16). Detailed analysis of the\ndiaries of the patients indicated signi ﬁcant decrease in the mean\nnumber of symptomatic days with diarrhea, ﬂushing and\nabdominal pain which are the major symptoms of the patients\nwith NETs ( 17). In summary, NETTER-1 study demonstrated\nthat the use of ¹ ⁷⁷Lu-DOTATATE improved PFS and quality of\nlife (QoL) together with a well-disposed safety pro ﬁle.\nAnother alternative radiolabeled synthetic somatostatin\nanalogue DOTATOC (Edotreotid e) has been developed for the\nimaging and treatment of GEP-NETs The in vivo pharmacokinetics\nof the Lu-177-labeled peptides DOTATATE, DOTANOC, and\nDOTATOC have been investigate d in patients with GEP-NETs\n(18). This study demonstrated f avorable pharmacokinetic\nproperties of radiolabeled DOTATOC with a more rapid\nclearance from healthy organs compared to DOTATATE and\nDOTANOC, providing a high tumor to background ratio and\nhence a high targeted dose of radiation to the tumor.\nTheﬁrst systematic evaluation of treatment data with n.c.a. Lu-\n177-Edotreotide in patients with GEP-NETs was reported by Baum\net al. ( 19).

No serious adverse event s were noted, with no evidence of\nrenal toxicity. In addition, a long -term safety follow-up of patients\nincluded in the retrospective study showed no lasting relevant\nhematotoxic effects and no long-term renal toxicity for up to 6\nyears after the 1stPRRT. At the present time, it is standard practice\nto provide renal protection with a 2,5% lysine/arginine infusion\nwhich is given concomitantly with the PRRT infusion ( 20).\nBased on the data from the study of Baum et al. ( 19), a\nPhase-III pivotal clinical trial, COMPETE has been initiated.\nCOMPETE is a prospective, randomized, open-label multi-\ncenter Phase III study to evaluate the safety and ef ﬁcacy of\nn.c.a.

13E advanced RAG,What are the benefits of PRRT?,english,general,advantages of therapy,gpt-4o advanced RAG,"Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT) offers several benefits for patients with neuroendocrine tumors (NETs):

1. **Tumor Control**: PRRT is effective in reducing tumor growth and improving progression-free survival (PFS). Studies have shown that PRRT can provide a PFS comparable to, and in some cases superior to, other treatment modalities (Rogoza et al., 2022, p. 15).

2. **Symptom Control**: PRRT can lead to symptomatic improvement in NET patients, including those with associated hormonal syndromes. It has been shown to improve quality of life (QoL) significantly, with positive outcomes in domains such as global health, physical functioning, diarrhea, pain, body image, disease-related worries, and fatigue (Cancers, 2022, p. 4).

3. **Quality of Life**: The NETTER-1 trial demonstrated that PRRT with 177Lu-DOTATATE significantly improves patient quality of life compared to high-dose octreotide (Rogoza et al., 2022, p. 15).

4. **Safety**: PRRT has an acceptable safety profile, with transient hematotoxicity being the most common side effect, which usually recovers rapidly. Long-term myelodysplasia or leukemia occurs in a small percentage of patients (Harris and Zhernosekov, 2022, p. 6).

5. **Symptomatic Improvement in Carcinoid Syndrome**: PRRT has shown effectiveness in controlling symptoms of carcinoid syndrome, such as flushing and bowel movement frequency (Cancers, 2022, p. 4).

6. **Potential for Retreatment**: Retreatment with 177Lu-DOTATATE-based PRRT has shown optimistic survival benefits with acceptable safety in patients with NETs (Rogoza et al., 2022, p. 15).

7. **Neoadjuvant Therapy**: PRRT is becoming increasingly important in a neoadjuvant setting, showing significant reduction in tumor size and rendering inoperable tumors operable in some cases (Rogoza et al., 2022, p. 15).

Sub-study A will compare the cumulative absorbed\ndoses to kidneys and target lesions extrapolated from dose 1 to\nthe cumulative absorbed dose from all 4 infusions. In sub-study\nB, the absorbed dose estimated by 3D dosimetry will be\ncompared to estimates from planar 2D and hybrid 2D/3D\ndosimetry. It is expected that the dosimetry data from these\nstudies will facilitate the a pplication of dosimetry to\nindividualized therapy, rather than the standard ‘one size ﬁts\nall’approach.\nThe currently available data for PRRT of NET patients are\nmainly for those with advanced disease, who have receivedprevious therapies. These patients inevitably relapse at some\nstage. Earlier positioning in the treatment algorithm is of\nparticular interest and data for the ﬁrst-line therapy will be\nforthcoming from COMPETE ,C O M P O S Ea n dN E T T E R - 2\ntrials. Neoadjuvant therapy in PNETs is a subject of interest\nwith anectodal reports of bene ﬁcial surgical outcomes in some\npatients ( 31).\nIt is apparent from dosimetry and safety that many patients\nare able to receive and bene ﬁt from additional cycles of\ntreatment ( 32,33).', 'When appropriate patient selection is performed, PRRT is accompanied by limited risks\nfor renal and hematological toxicities. Treatment of NET patients with PRRT requires dedicated\nclinical expertise due to the biological characteristics of PRRT and speciﬁc characteristics of NET\npatients. This review provides an overview for clinicians dealing with NET on the history, molecular\ncharacteristics, efﬁcacy, toxicity and relevant clinical speciﬁcs of PRRT.\nKeywords: peptide receptor radionuclide therapy;177Lu-DOTATATE; guide; neuroendocrine tumors\n1. Introduction\nPeptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) with radiolabeled somatostatin analogs\n(SSAs) has become an established second- or third-line treatment option for patients with\nprogressive well-differentiated (grade 1–2) gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) neuroendocrine\ntumors (NETs). Due to the increasing incidence and prevalence of GEP-NETs over recent\ndecades [ 1] and the development of NET-speciﬁc treatments and treatment protocols, there\nis a growing utilization of such systemic treatment for this advanced patient group. PRRT\nwith [177Lu]Lu-[DOTA0,Tyr3]octreotate (177Lu-DOTATATE) is the ﬁrst registered theranos-\ntic application in the ﬁeld of NETs [ 2,3]. With this therapy, radiolabeled SSAs target the\nsomatostatin receptor (SSTR) subtype 2 that is over-expressed on the cancer cell surface [ 4].\nTreatment of NET patients with PRRT requires dedicated clinical expertise due to the\nbiological characteristics of PRRT (for example, binding to SSTR, DNA damage induction\nCancers 2022 ,14, 5792. https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers14235792 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/cancers', 'PRRT is only applicable for pa-\ntients with a Karnofsky Performance Scale of at least 60 [ 27]. PRRT is contra-indicated\nfor patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding, patients with severe cardiac impairment\n(NYHA III or IV) and those with a life expectancy less than 3 months [ 31]. Since PRRT\ncan induce toxicity, the following pre-treatment laboratory values are required: creatinine\nclearance > 40 mL/min, hemoglobin levels ≥6 mmol/L, leukocytes > 2 ×109/L, platelet\ncount > 75 ×109/L, bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) and aspartate aminotrans-\nferase (ASAT) < 3 times the upper limit of normal and albumin > 3 g/dL [2,3].\n8. PRRT-Related Toxicity\nAdverse events related to PRRT are frequently mild and include nausea, abdominal pain\nand asthenia [ 27,50]. Increased hair loss is observed in up to 60% of patients treated with\n177Lu-DOTATATE, but this is temporary and seldom leads to baldness [ 88]. Besides these\nmild adverse events, PRRT can induce more severe toxicities which can be dose-limiting and\nadjustments to the treatment schedule might be required [ 89].

14E advanced RAG,What are the challenges of PRRT?,english,general,challenges of therapy,gpt-4o advanced RAG,"Challenges of Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT) include:

1. **Patient Eligibility**: PRRT is only applicable for patients with a Karnofsky Performance Scale of at least 60 and is contraindicated for pregnant or breastfeeding patients, those with severe cardiac impairment (NYHA III or IV), and those with a life expectancy of less than 3 months (A Clinical Guide to Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy, p. 7).

2. **Toxicity**: PRRT can induce both mild and severe toxicities. Mild adverse events include nausea, abdominal pain, and asthenia, while more severe toxicities can be dose-limiting and may require adjustments to the treatment schedule (A Clinical Guide to Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy, p. 7). Hematotoxic effects such as myelosuppression, lymphopenia, and hepatotoxicity have also been reported (Camus et al., 2021, p. 11).

3. **Long-term Side Effects**: Long-term side effects can include renal failure and leukemic or myelodysplastic syndromes. The risk of severe nephrotoxicity is higher in patients with diabetes and poorly controlled hypertension (Camus et al., 2021, p. 11; Hirmas et al., 2018, p. 196).

4. **Management of Side Effects**: Acute side effects like nausea and vomiting are related to the concomitant administration of kidney-protective amino acids. Subacute side effects include bone marrow suppression and mild hair loss. Long-term side effects require careful management, especially in patients with comorbidities affecting kidney function (Hirmas et al., 2018, p. 196).

5. **Salvage Therapy**: Retreatment with PRRT as salvage therapy may be considered when better options are not available, but the tumor response rate is generally less compared to initial treatment (Hirmas et al., 2018, p. 196).

These challenges necessitate careful patient selection, monitoring, and management to optimize the benefits of PRRT while minimizing its risks.","['PRRT is only applicable for pa-\ntients with a Karnofsky Performance Scale of at least 60 [ 27]. PRRT is contra-indicated\nfor patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding, patients with severe cardiac impairment\n(NYHA III or IV) and those with a life expectancy less than 3 months [ 31].

PRRT-Related Toxicity\nAdverse events related to PRRT are frequently mild and include nausea, abdominal pain\nand asthenia [ 27,50]. Increased hair loss is observed in up to 60% of patients treated with\n177Lu-DOTATATE, but this is temporary and seldom leads to baldness [ 88].

When the toxicity has subsided\nwithin 16 weeks after the last dose, guidelines advise to administer half of the original activity\nof177Lu-DOTATATE during the next cycle. PRRT should be discontinued when the toxicity\npersists after 16 weeks or recurs after the half dose [ 3]. In the NETTER-1 trial, 7% of the\npatients received a reduced dose because of dose-limiting toxicities [ 27]. The kidneys and the\nbone marrow are the critical organs for dose-limiting toxicities.', 'J. Clin. Med. 2021 ,10, 1267 11 of 15\n4.5.1. Subacute Effects\nPRRT is overall well tolerated with most patients experiencing only moderate toxicity.\nIn the study NETTER-1, validating the PRRT in midgut NETs, 5% of the patients discon-\ntinued treatment due to toxicity related to PRRT. Acute side effects are mainly nausea,\nvomiting, fatigue and abdominal pain. These adverse events are mainly caused by the\nsimultaneous infusion of aminoacids. Particular vigilance must be exercised with regard\nto the risk of carcinoid crisis. This event was reported in a very small minority (1%) of\npatients who received an PRRT treatment. This crisis usually appears within 48 h of the ﬁrst\ninfusion and is related to the massive release of active amines [ 34]. A myelosuppressure\nhas been described and is caused by the irradiation of the bone marrow. Bone marrow\nis particularly radiosensitive, and this toxicity does not appear to be associated to the\nexpression of SSTRs in myeloid cells. Myelosuppression generally develops four at six\nweeks after the infusion, is usually grade 1/2 and is reversible. Hematotoxic effects grade\n3 and 4 have been described in 13% and 10% of the patients receiving90Y-DOTATOC\nand177Lu-DOTATATE, respectively [ 35]. Lymphopenia is the more often reported severe\ncytopenia. Some studies have also reported that PRRT could be safely used in the case\nof diffuse metastatic bone marrow involvement, without irreversible myelosuppression,\nalthough a higher incidence of subacute transient hematologic toxicity was observed [36]\nOther toxicities have been reported, including a risk of hepatotoxicity in the patients\nwith major liver involvement. Thus, as indicated above, it is desirable to consider PRRT\nearly in the management process of the disease.\n4.5.2. Long-Term Effects\nLong-term side effects of PRRT can include renal failure and leukemic or myelodys-\nplastic syndromes.\nThe radiolabels are reabsorbed in the proximal tubules, may accumulate in the proxi-\nmal tubules in the renal interstitium and cause kidney damage. Because of its higher energy\nand longer penetration range,90Y irradiates the renal interstitium glomeruli more exten-\nsively than177Lu. In a large institutional series of 1109 patients treated with90Y-DOTATOC,\n103 patients (9%) were treated with90Y-DOTATOC with severe renal toxicity [ 7]. Nowa-\ndays, the concomitant administration positively charged aminoacids results in a reduction\nof up to 40% of the renal absorption. Despite renal protection, the median decrease of the\ncreatinine clearance is estimated to 4% per year in patients treated with177Lu-DOTATATE.\nThe risk factors for nephrotoxicity cited are diabetes and poorly controlled hypertension.\nRisk of severe nephrotoxicity (grade 3/4) was observed in only 1.5% of patients [ 37]. In\noverall, end-stage renal disease as a consequence of PRRT is extremely rare.\nCases of leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes have been reported as late-onset\nPRRT toxicity, with an estimated incidence of up to 2% [ 37,38]. Age over 70 years, cytopenia\nbefore treatment, the presence of bones metastasis, the high number of previous treatments,\nthe prior use of an alkylating agent and the radiotherapy increases the risk of secondary\nmyelodysplastic syndrome. Brieau et al. reported in a retrospective monocentric study\nconducted in a population of patients treated with PRRT and pre-treatment alkylating\nchemotherapy an increased risk late hematologic toxicity (20%; four patients out of 20) [ 39].\nThe main alkylating agent used in the NET treatment is temozolomide. The development\nof myelodysplastic syndrome or leukemia has been reported between 30 and 70 months\nafter treatment with PRRT [ 39].', 'Salvage Treatment\nAlthough tumor response rates after initial treatment with\nPRRT are encouraging, CR is rare and eventually tumor pro-\ngression occurs in the majority of patients. Retreatment with\nextra cycles of PRRT as salvage therapy may be consideredwhen better options are not available. One study showed that\nsalvage therapy with two additional cycles of\n177Lu-octreotate\ndoes not lead to serious hematologic or nephrotoxic side ef-\nfects, but the tumor response rate was less compared with\ninitial treatment [ 50].\nAnother report showed that long PFS after the initial treat-\nment with PRRT predicts a prolonged PFS after salvage ther-apy [ 51], and argued that PRRT with\n177Lu-octreotate in the\nretreatment setting is a safe and effective option in patients\nwith metastatic GEP-NETs. For these reasons, retreatment\nseems a good option for patients who responded well after\nthe initial cycles of PRRT [ 52]. This novel and important\nconcept of salvage therapy of NET needs to be tested in large,\nprospective, and multi-center trials to contribute to evidence-\nbased findings.\nTreatment Side Effects\nPRRT is generally well-tolerated. Side effects can be divided to\nacute, subacute, and long-term side effects, as summarized inTable 4. Acute side effects are usually mild and self-limiting.\nNausea or vomiting are related to the concomitant admin-\nistration of kidney-protective amino acids. Subacute side\neffects are related to the radiopeptide itself, such as bonemarrow suppression, mild hair loss (observed with\n177Lu-\noctreotate), or, more rarely, an exacerbation of a clinicalsyndrome. The most common subacute side effect ofPRRT, occurring within 4 to 6 weeks after therapy, is bone\nmarrow suppression. Usually, the hematologic toxicity is\nmild and reversible. More serious WHO grade 3 or 4 tox-icity may occur, but this has been seen in less than 15% of\npatients [ 53].\nLong-term side effects of PRRT may include renal failure\nas well as leukemia/myelody splastic syndromes (MDS).\nBecause radiopeptides are usually reabsorbed in the proximal\ntubules, they can accumulate in the renal interstitium and in-duce inflammation and fibrosis with eventual kidney damage.\nCo-administration of positively charged amino acids results ina reduction of renal radioactive uptake, up to 40% as reportedin some studies [ 16,54]. If patients have long-standing or\npoorly controlled comorbidities such as diabetes and hyper-\ntension that affect kidney function, it is expected that there\nwould be a larger and more persistent decline in creatinine\nclearance [ 55].\nAdministration of Treatment\nFor purposes of kidney protection, positively charged amino\nacids, such as L-lysine and/or L-arginine, are co-infused to\ncompetitively inhibit the proximal tubular reabsorption ofthe radiopeptide [ 56]. This reduces the renal-absorbed dose.\nDilution of the amino acids with saline allows proper hydra-tion for the patient, an appropriate ratio to use is 25 g of aminoacid in 1 L of normal saline. Obviously, patients ’comorbidi-\nties should be taken into account (e.g., avoid volume overloadin patients with cardiac insufficiency and take care in avoidingelectrolyte imbalances with hyperosmotic solutions).\nAntiemetics can be administered before the infusion to avoidpotential nausea or vomiting. Amino acid infusion should bestarted 30 –60 min before administration of the radiopeptide\nand should be maintained over 4 h. Several amino acid pro-tective schemes have been proposed in the joint IAEA,EANM, and SNMMI practical guidelines on PRRT treatment\nof NETs [ 56].\nCurrent administration schedules comprise the most ap-\npropriate number of cycles (generally four or five) and thebest delivery frequency (8 weeks apart). This pattern allows\nthe patient to recover from the mild side effects of the ther-apy and increases its effectiveness in terms of the radiobi-\nological activity [ 57]. Radioisotope infusion should be\naround 30 min as recommended in the literature.']",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,0.0,1.0,0.5,277

These frequently develop \nmetastatic disease with limited treatment options.1\nFor well -differentiated high grade 2 and 3 GEP -NETs, current \ntherapies include peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT), \nsomatostatin analogues, chemotherapy, cytoreduction and \nmolecular targeted therapies (everolimus, sunitinib) with no \nspecified use sequence. \nPRRT uses radiolabelled somatostatin analogues to selectively \ntarget somatostatin receptor expressing (SSTR+) tumour cells. \nUse may stabilise disease and induce objective tumour \nresponse.2\n177Lu edotreotide is an innovative radiolabelled somatostatin \nanalogue with promising efficacy and a favourable safety \nprofile.2,3Retrospective data in metastatic GEP -NETs treated \nwith ≥2 cycles of 177Lu-edotreotide demonstrate progression \nfree survival (PFS) of ≥30 months (Figure 1).3\nThe Phase III COMPETE trial , which has completed patient \nrecruitment, is comparing 177Lu edotreotide efficacy/safety \nversus everolimus in grade 1 and 2 GEP -NETs.4References\n1.

The antibody is prepared from serum-free hybridoma su-pernatants. It is radiolabeled by the method of oxida-tion of radioactive iodine with iodogen. It is commer -\ncially available, and the I-131 radiolabelled tositum-omab solution contains additives (Providon, maltose, and ascorbic acid) to limit radiolysis (Cheson, 2003; Press et al., 2001). Another FDA-approved radiophar -\nmaceutical used for B-cell Non-Hodgkins therapy is Yttrium-90-ibritumomab (Zevalin). Ibritumomab is a murine IgG1a kappa antibody and is used to treat lymphomas (Barbet et al., 2009). Yttrium-90 is a pure beta emitter, so problems caused by high-energy gam-ma rays emitted by iodine-131 do not arise. However, \nsince Y-90 does not emit gamma rays, gamma imag-\ning, and subsequent dosimetry calculations cannot be made. For this reason, indium-111 (In-111) is used with the Y-90 as it allows pre-treatment imaging for dosimetry evaluation and patient-specific dosing. In-111-ibritumomab tiuxetan and Y-90-ibritumomab tiuxetan are used to treat relapsed or refractory low-grade, follicular, or transformed B-cell NHL patients,', '95\nFABAD J. Pharm. Sci., 46, 1, 93-104, 20211.1. Diagnosis of Diseases with Radiopharma-\nceuticals\nRadiopharmaceuticals that emit gamma rays are \nused in nuclear medicine to diagnose disease and \ndetermine the condition and function of specific tis-sue and organ (Gundogdu et al., 2018). There are two standard methods to diagnose the disease with radio-pharmaceuticals:\nNon-image diagnostic applications: The radiophar -\nmaceutical is reached to the desired organ/tissue, and radioactivity is counted from outside. The radioac-tivity calculation in the organ can be calculated with the Medical Internal Radiation Dose (MIRD), and the body surface area can be calculated using Monte Carlo methods (Kovan, 2016).\nImage diagnostic applications: The radiopharma-\nceutical is reached to desired organ/tissue and the or -\ngan/tissue is imaged by various imaging systems such as gamma cameras, single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), Positron Emission Tomogra-phy (PET), SPECT/CT, and PET/CT hybrid systems  (Gundogdu et al., 2018).\n1.2. Treatment of Diseases with Radiopharma-\nceuticals\nRadiopharmaceuticals that emit alpha and beta \nrays are administered in many nuclear medicine treat-ment studies. The radiopharmaceuticals are given to the patient and kept in the target tissue/organ. They destroy diseased tissue and provide the treatment. In this way, near/healthy tissues are exposed to dose as low as possible and targeted therapy occurs (Kovan, 2016; Sivri et al., 2004). The properties of the radionu-clides used for radionuclide therapy are given in Table 3. Elemental, metabolic, pharmaceutical agents, an-tibodies, bone imaging chelates, bioreducing agents, labeled cells, liposomes, microspheres, nanoparticles and niosomes are radiolabeled with radionuclides suitable for the treatment of diseases. These have some advantages:\n•\t They\tare\tnon-invasive\ttreatment,•\t They\t show\tmedium\t and\tlong-term\t low\tside\tef-fects,\n•\t These\t agents\tare\tuseful\tbecause\tthey\tcan\tbe\ttarget-\ned.\n•\t The\tdose\tin\tnormal\ttissue\tis\tlow\tbecause\tthese\t\nagents can be absorbed in desired tissues (Sivri et \nal., 2004).\nThere are many radiopharmaceuticals that are \nused in the treatment of some diseases. The samples of \nradiopharmaceuticals are summarized below. \nClassification of Treatments Using Radiopharma-\nceutics:\n1. Radioactive iodine therapy in thyroid diseases2. Radiopharmaceutical treatment in metastatic \nbone pain\n3. Radionuclidic therapy in neuroendocrine tu-\nmors\n4. Treatment with labeled antibody5. Intra-cavitary radiocolloid therapy6. Radiation synovectomy7. Radionuclidic therapy in myeloproliferative dis-\neases\n8. Intra-arterial radionuclide therapy by radiola-\nbeled microspheres\n 1.2.1 Iodine-131 Treatment in Thyroid Diseases\nThe treatment of benign and malignant diseases \nof the thyroid can be done with Iodine-131 (I-131). \nRadioiodine therapy has been used for a long time. In treating diseases such as hyperthyroidism, I-131 ra-dionuclide settles in the thyroid tissue. It destroys the follicle cells with the beta particles it emits and stops the growth and activities of the thyroid cells. In this case, it returns the functions of the overactive thyroid gland to normal (Mumtaz et al., 2009).  In malignant diseases such as thyroid cancer, radioactive iodine therapy can also be applied to remove residual thyroid gland residues after thyroid surgery and treatment of the spread of thyroid cancers in the body. Since the dose of radioactive iodine preferred in the treatment of thyroid cancers is higher than the iodine dose in the treatment of hyperthyroidism, the patient should sleep in a room specially prepared for radioiodine']",2.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,1.0,0,1.0,1.0,1.0,17

The naked, unstable radionuclide incor-\nporates into the extracellular environment, and the α particle \nemission in the tumor microenvironment suppresses abnormal \nbone formation and induces cell death (20). The phase 3 AL-\nSYMPCA (or, ΑLpharadin in SYMPtomatic Prostate CAncer) \ntrial demonstrated that 223RaCl2 was well tolerated and im-\nproved median overall survival to 14.9 months in the treat-\nment arm versus 11.3 months in the placebo arm (30% risk \nreduction; hazard ratio, 0.70 [95% CI: 0.58, 0.83]; P < .001); \nit also improved the median time to first symptomatic skeletal \nevent to 15.6 months in the radium arm versus 9.8 months in \nthe placebo arm (34% risk reduction; hazard ratio, 0.66 [95% \nCI: 0.52, 0.83]; P < .001) (19).\nSomatostatin Receptor–targeted Radionuclide Therapy\nSomatostatin receptors (SSR), particularly SSR2a, expressing \nneuroendocrine tumors (NETs) of the pancreas and midgut \ncan be imaged with gallium 68 (68Ga) DOTA peptides (DOT -\nATATE [tetraazacyclododecane tetraacetic acid octreotate], \nDOTANOC [tetraazacyclododecane tetraacetic acid sodium \ntriiodide octreotide], and DOTATOC [tetraazacyclododecane \ntetraacetic acid D-phenylalanine 1 tyrosine 3 octreotide]), in-\ndium 111 (111In) octreotide, or 99 mTc-octreotide and treated \nwith 177Lu-DOTA-peptides or yttrium 99 octreotate (21) as a \ntheranostic pair.

In 2018, FDA approval of \n177Lu-DOTATATE for NETs represented a major addition to \nthe treatment options for patients with these tumors (21). Sub-\nsequently, the NETTER-1 trial did not demonstrate a statisti-\ncally significant increase in overall survival at 5 years, compli-\ncated by high crossover within the randomized control group \n(36% of the controls subsequently received SSR-coupled ra-\ndionuclide therapy) (23).

The success of iodide-131 in targeting and \ntreating thyroid disorders and carcinomas encouraged \nthe expansion of its use in a variety of cancers through \nits incorporation into targeting vectors. For example, iobenguane I-131 is the radioiodinated small- molecule \nmeta - iodobenzylguanidine ([\n131I]mIBG), an analogue of  \nthe adrenergic neutrotransmitter noradrenaline that \nis used to treat patients with neuroblastomas140– 142. \nIodide-131 can be introduced to targeting vectors as a highly reactive electrophilic iodine compound, allowing \nrapid iodination of molecules containing activated aro-matic groups, or through displacement by nucleophilic attack of the radioiodide\n143. mIBG radiolabelled with \nhigh- specific- activity iodine-131 was recently approved \nby the FDA for the treatment of adult and paediatric patients aged 12 years or older with unresectable meta-static phaeochromocytoma or paraganglioma. No FDA-  \napproved therapy was available for these conditions \nbefore approval of this agent. Use of this agent requires \na positive mIBG imaging scan, standard, weight- based \ntherapeutic dosing and the application of a process for individualized dosimetry using a pretreatment tracer \nstudy to calculate absorbed doses for normal organs. \nNormal organ dosimetry is used to adjust the activity administered so that the organ doses are below speci-fied threshold levels. FDA approval of this agent was \nbased on the substantial pre- existing experience with \n[\n131I]mIBG144– 151 and on a recent phase I study which \nyielded 1-  year and 2-  year overall survival of 85.7% and \n61.9%, respectively, in 21 patients treated with the maxi-\nmum tolerated dose152. Clinical trials using this agent are \nongoing (NCT03561259 and NCT02378428).\nPSMA and folate receptor ligands. The past decade has \nseen increasing use of small- molecule radiotherapeutics \ntargeting receptors such as PSMA receptor and folate \nreceptor (FR). Small- molecule PSMA inhibitors have \nbeen modified to deliver radiotherapeutic nuclides in \nprostate cancer as well as other cancers owing to the expression of PSMA on the neovasculature of tumours. \nPSMA inhibitors are designed to mimic its substrates, \nγ- glutamyl folic acid derivatives and the neuropeptide \nN- acetylaspartylglutamate\n153,154. These small- molecule \nRPT agents are either urea- based inhibitors (for \nexample, 177Lu- labelled PSMA- R2 and 177Lu- labelled  \nPSMA-617)155– 162 or phosphoramidate- based inhibitors \n(for example, 177Lu- labelled CTT-1403) modified to \ndeliver therapeutic radionuclides163– 165. The urea and \nphosphoramidate functionalities interact with zinc(ii) \nlocated in the PSMA active site; in addition, these small \nmolecules are designed to interact with the S1 glutamate pocket as well as the entrance funnel of PSMA \n(fIG.4a,b) . \nThe entrance funnel allows a wide variation of modi -\nfications to present a pendant group or a chelator for radiolabelling with therapeutic and imaging radio-nuclides.

Besides, peptide receptor radionu\n-\nclide treatments have positive results in combination with systemic therapies used in patients with neuro\n-\nendocrine tumors, and serious toxic effects are not en -\ncountered (Ozkan, 2019). Neuroendocrine cancers are cancers that are generally seen in the intestine, stom\n-\nach, pancreas, and lung systems. Lu-177 dotatate and I-131-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) are current\n-\nly used in the treatment of neuroendocrine cancers.\n1.2.3.1. I-131-MIBG Treatment\nI-131-MIBG is highly effective in pheochromo-\ncytoma and neuroblastoma. Also, I-131-MIBG is less \neffective in paraganglioma, carcinoid tumors, and medullary thyroid cancer. This treatment is not pre-ferred in pregnant patients. Renal functions and bone marrow reserve should be sufficient for the success of the treatment.\nRadiation affects the cells by using ß-rays emitted \nfrom the I-131 MIBG being held by neighboring cells. Therefore, isolated cells are exposed to radiation less than macroscopic tumors and cell clumps. As a re-sult, smaller tumors are exposed to radiation less, and the chance of treatment is less (Grünwald et al., 2010; Adalet et al., 2012).\n1.2.3.2. Lutetium-177 Dotatate Treatment\nLutetium-177 Dotatate is a prescribed radiophar -\nmaceutical used in the treatment of gastroenteropan-\ncreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs). This ra-diopharmaceutical concentrates on the tumor struc-ture and treats the cancer with beta rays. This form of treatment is applied 4 or 5 times with an average of two months’ periods. In this treatment, critical or -\ngans such as the kidney, bone marrow, and liver are exposed to some dosage. The radiation dose in the tar -get organ is adjusted according to the maximum treat-ment dose of the treatment and the patient’s weight (Kovan, 2016).\n1.2.4. Treatment with Labeled Antibody\nRadio-labeled antibodies were first studied for tu-\nmor imaging, but with the use of F-18-FDG in pos-\nitron emission tomography, radio-labeled antibodies are no longer used for tumor detection. Later studies have shown that radiolabeled antibodies are useful in treating lymphoma (Barbet et al., 2009). Tositumom-ab, known as anti-B1, is a monoclonal antibody with an affinity for the CD20 antigen expressed on normal B-lymphocytes. CD20 is described in the majority of B cell lymphomas (Press et al., 2001). This antibody inhibits tumor growth in both animal models and humans (Buchsbaum et al., 1992). Tositumomab was radiolabeled with antibody I-131 (Bexxar), and B cell Non-Hodgkins was used for treatment and was ap-proved by the FDA. Tositumomab can inhibit tumor growth in animal models and humans, but it was not developed as a human-mouse chimeric antibody. The antibody is prepared from serum-free hybridoma su-pernatants. It is radiolabeled by the method of oxida-tion of radioactive iodine with iodogen. It is commer -\ncially available, and the I-131 radiolabelled tositum-omab solution contains additives (Providon, maltose, and ascorbic acid) to limit radiolysis (Cheson, 2003; Press et al., 2001). Another FDA-approved radiophar -\nmaceutical used for B-cell Non-Hodgkins therapy is Yttrium-90-ibritumomab (Zevalin).']",0.0,0.4,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1.0,0.0,0.5,80

Despite signiﬁ-\ncant advances in systemic therapy options, the prognosis for metastatic castration-resistant\nprostate cancer (mCRPC) is poor, with overall survival under two years [2].\nProstate-speciﬁc membrane antigen (PSMA) is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein\nreceptor that is overexpressed (up to 1000 times more than normal prostate cells) in most\nprostate cancers (>90%). PSMA is normally expressed in the renal tubules and duodenum,\nin which it plays an essential role in the processing and uptake of dietary folates, and in\nthe brain, where it plays a major role in modulating the output of glutamate signaling.\nThe biological function of PSMA in prostate cancer remains elusive, although evidence\nsuggests its role in activation of PI3K-Akt signaling in prostate cancer through release of\nglutamate as messenger molecule [ 3]. The level of expression may increase with tumor\ndedifferentiation and castration resistance, although neuroendocrine prostate cancer may\nhave a decreased level of PSMA [ 4]. Even though this antigen is not entirely speciﬁc to\nprostate cancer cells, it can serve as a target for imaging and therapy due to its tumoral\noverexpression with relatively low toxicity to healthy tissues showing uptake [5].\n2. PSMA PET Imaging in Prostate Cancer\n2.1. Imaging Modalities\nMany PSMA-targeting small molecule and antibody agents have been developed and\ntested for imaging by single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) and\npositron emission tomography (PET). Compared to anti-PSMA antibodies, small-molecule\nPSMA inhibitors are preferable as PET imaging agents due to faster tumor uptake and more\nrapid excretion, which enhance contrast and reduce radiation exposure [ 6,7]. Currently,\nthe most developed radioligands for imaging include gallium-68-labeled PSMA-11 (68Ga-\nPSMA-11), gallium-68-labeled PSMA-I&T (68Ga-PSMA-I&T), and ﬂuorine-18 (18F) labeled\nPSMA ligands, including18F-DCFPyL and18F-PSMA-1007. There is no consensus as\nto the optimal PSMA radioligand. Currently,68Ga-PSMA-11 and18F-DCFPyL are the\nonly FDA-approved radioligands for PSMA-targeted PET imaging in men with prostate\ncancer [8,9].\nThe ﬂuorinated agents have the advantage of a longer half-life which allows for central\nproduction and distribution over longer distances as well as lower positron energy that\ncan lead to improved imaging quality.18F-PSMA-1007 has been found to have diagnostic\naccuracy comparable to68Ga-PSMA-11 for detection of biochemically recurrent prostate\ncancer, with the advantage of minimal excretion in the urinary tract, which allows for better\ndetection of prostate bed recurrences [ 10,11]. However, cautions need to be taken when\ninterpreting18F-PSMA-1007 PET scans, as there have been reports of focal unspeciﬁc bone\nuptake, deﬁned as focal mild-to-moderate uptake (SUVmax < 10.0) not obviously related\nto a benign or malignant cause [12].\n2.2. Clinical Applications of PSMA-Targeted Imaging\nPSMA-targeted imaging has been extensively explored in primary staging and restag-\ning of prostate cancer. Conventional imaging with CT, MRI and bone scan have limited\nsensitivity and speciﬁcity for detecting occult metastatic disease, particularly in the setting\nof low PSA values [ 13]. Prospective studies have demonstrated advantage of PSMA-\ntargeted imaging in both primary staging, as well as in the biochemical recurrence setting\nin providing useful clinical information that may ultimately change management [ 14–17].\nVarious international guidelines have recommended PSMA-PET imaging to be performed\nfor the clariﬁcation of equivocal ﬁndings, particularly if the results will inﬂuence subse-\nquent treatment decisions [18,19].', 'changes (e.g., benign prostatic hyperplasia) ( 23). Notably, choline\nderivatives and18F-FDG have shown potential in assessing the\ntherapy response in mCRPC ( 24,25 ). Most recently, 1-amino-\n3-18F-ﬂuorocyclobutane-1-carboxylic acid, an amino acid transport\nimaging agent, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Admin-\nistration; however, its detection rate in recurrent PC is similar to\nthose of choline derivatives ( 26,27 ).\nUNMET CLINICAL NEEDS IN PC\nAccurate staging in primary PC and localization of early BCR\nfor tailoring initial and subsequent treatment strategies are un-\nmet clinical needs. Once mCRPC is diagnosed, effective therapy\nfor improving overall survival and quality of life is desperately\nneeded. Prostate-speciﬁc membrane antigen (PSMA) ligands are\ncurrently being investigated intensively, as they hold promise\nfor extending the frontier in PC imaging and radioligand therapy\n(RLT). This review is intended to deliver a comprehensive overview\nof current and past investigations of low-molecular-weight PSMA\nradioligands for PC imaging and t herapy. Providing insights into\npast and promising current developments regarding PSMA anti-\nbody imaging, especially targeting J591, is beyond the scope of this\nreview.\nPSMA AS TARGET FOR PC IMAGING AND THERAPY\nPSMA is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein. PSMA expres-\nsion and localization in the normal human prostate are associated\nwith the cytoplasm and apical side of the epithelium surrounding\nthe prostatic ducts ( 28). PSMA is enzymatically active only in its\ndimeric form, but its function for prostate cells is still unknown\n(29). Dysplastic and neoplastic transformation of prostate tissue\nresults in the transfer of PSMA from the apical membrane to the\nluminal surface of the ducts ( 30,31 ). For several reasons, PSMA is\nan ideal target in PC.\nFirst, it is signiﬁcantly overexpressed (100–1,000 fold) on nearly\nall PC cells ( 32–35), although 5%–10% of primary PC or PC lesions\nhad negative PSMA results on PET ( 36,37 ). However, the underly-\ning etiology of PC with negative PSMA results on PET is still\nunclear, given the lack of prospective studies and correlation with\nimmunohistochemistry.\nSecond, its expression is further increased in advanced stages\nand in mCRPC ( 32,34,38 ).\nThird, after binding to the active center of the extracellular do-\nmain, PSMA ligands are internalized. Subsequent endosomal\nrecycling increases the deposition, leading to enhanced tumor uptake,\nretention, and subsequent high i mage quality for diagnostic proce-\ndures and a high local dose for therapeutic applications ( 29,39,40 ).\nPreclinical data showed that PSMA expression is independent\nof the use of taxane-based chemotherapy. This property may allow\ndirect PC imaging—an advantage over bone scintigraphy and CT\nimaging—without the “ﬂare phenomenon” ( 41). However, gene\ntranscription analysis demonstrated that androgen can suppress\nthe promoter of the PSMA gene ( 42,43 ). Therefore, the initiation\nof androgen deprivation therapy induces early but temporary upre-\ngulation of PSMA expression, downregulation under prolonged\nandrogen deprivation therapy and, ﬁnally, overexpression of PSMA\nin androgen-resistant tumors ( 44–47). A preliminary work outlined\nthis effect, which could be leveraged for improved diagnosis and\ntherapy ( 48).\nInterestingly, PSMA expression in the tumor neovasculature of\nsome solid tumors (colon, breast, kidney, and subtypes of bladdercancer) poses potential pitfalls in imaging ( 32,49 –54) but also\noffers potential opportunities for theranostic applications in can-\ncers other than PC.\nCOMPREHENSIVE OVERVIEW OF DIFFERENT CLASSES OF\nPSMA LIGANDS IN CLINICAL USE\nTo date, no PSMA small molecule has been approved by the U.S.\nFood and Drug Administration or European Medicines Agency.', 'Cancers 2020 ,12, 1367 6 of 14\nImproved localization of metastatic PCa using PSMA-targeted imaging may also increase the\nsuccess rate of metastasis-directed therapy (MDT), including stereotactic body radiotherapy (SABR).\nMDT intends to postpone systemic treatment for patients with oligometastatic disease, thereby\nreducing the side-e ﬀects of hormonal therapy. Prospective data suggest that SABR is well tolerated\nand improves PFS in patients with oligometastatic PCa [ 50]. In the randomized STOMP study, which\nused choline PET /CT, stereotactic ablation of oligometastatic disease in 62 patients delayed the need\nfor hormonal therapy from 13 to 21 months compared with surveillance [ 51]. Data from ORIOLE, a\nsimilar randomized Phase II study investigating the e ﬃcacy of SABR in forestalling metastases for\nhormone-sensitive PCa compared with observation, provide evidence for the value of PSMA PET /CT\nin controlling disease [ 52]. Patients randomized to the SABR arm of ORIOLE underwent18F-DCFPyl\nPET/CT, a urea-based PSMA radiotracer, prior to and 180 days after treatment. Patients with no\nadditional untreated lesions detected by PSMA PET /CT at baseline were signiﬁcantly less likely to\ndevelop new metastatic lesions at six months than those whose PSMA PET /CT showed at least one\nadditional lesion at baseline (16% vs. 63%, respectively).\nCurrently, the only PSMA-targeted imaging agent approved by the U.S. Food and Drug\nAdministration is111In-capromab pendetide (ProstaScint), which is approved for SPECT imaging of\nbiopsy-proven PCa localized to the prostatic bed but at high risk for pelvic LNM. Regulatory approval\nof PSMA radiotracers in the United States has lagged behind other areas of the world, such as Europe\nand Australia, where much of the innovation in PSMA theranostics has occurred. Given the growing\nevidence of the clinical potential of PSMA, its availability is expanding in the United States, and\nregulatory approval of novel radiotracers, including68Ga-PSMA-11 and18F-DCFPyl, is expected within\nthe next year. Ongoing clinical trials will help to better deﬁne the clinical role and impact of PSMA\nimaging and possibly strengthen the case for regulatory approval (Table 1). In sum, PSMA-targeted\nimaging has demonstrated clinical beneﬁts through targeting stereotactic ablation in oligometastatic\ndisease, but no studies have yet shown that PSMA-targeted imaging improves clinical outcomes for\nbiochemically recurrent PCa patients.\n4. PSMA Radioligand Therapy (RLT)\nPSMA has also emerged as a promising therapeutic molecular target. Although various therapies are\nnow approved for mCRPC, their survival benefit is generally limited to less than 6 months. There is thus a\nclinical need for novel therapies leading to a sustained response. Progress in the development of synthetic\nPSMA radioligands has led to an emerging body of research indicating significant therapeutic efficacy of\nPSMA RLT.\nPSMA RLT studies have mostly utilized small-molecule inhibitors of PSMA as radioligands, which\nhave been shown to be less hematotoxic than monoclonal antibodies. For instance, a study of MEDI3726\n(a PSMA-targeted antibody–drug conjugate) in patients with mCRPC after failure of abiraterone or\nenzalumatide observed significant responses at higher doses of MEDI3726, although responses were not\ndurable because patients discontinued therapy due to drug-related adverse events [ 53]. Small-molecule\nPSMA inhibitors have been labeled with both beta- and alpha-emitting radioisotopes, which have variable\nenergy levels and path lengths. Beta-emitting radioisotopes, such as lutetium-177 (177Lu), are the favored\nradioisotopes given their short maximal tissue penetration and relatively long half-life, permitting delivery\nof a high degree of radiation to PCa lesions.

This was\na heterogeneous group of patients both in terms of disease and\ntreatment. Overall, the median PFS was 9,6 months and the\nmedian OS was 19,9 months. When the patients were sub-grouped into NETs with a Ki-67 index of ≤55%, the median PFS\nwas 11 months and the OS 24 months. For NECs with a Ki-67\nindex of ≥55%, the median PFS was 4 months and the median\nOS was 7 months. In patients who had positive SSTR imaging\nbut negative F- ﬂuorodeoxyglucose (F-18-FDG) uptake, the\nprognosis was considerably improved. Other retrospective\nstudies have also reported bene ﬁcial responses to PRRT in G3\nNENs, particularly those with a Ki-67 index of ≤55% ( 22–24).\nThese low grade G3 NETs are of particular interest for further\nclinical development.

Is there a specific work-up in MEN1\npatients?\nThe molecular bases of NF-Pan-NET tumorigenesis is not well under-\nstood and although 90% of cases are sporadic a minority may be\nincluded in the context of important genetic syndromes such as\nMEN1, VHL and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) syndrome.83A sep-\narate ENETS guidance paper on MEN1 syndrome is currently being\nworked on at the same time as this manuscript.MEN1 is a rare autosomal dominantly inherited endocrine tumour\npredisposition syndrome, caused by germline heterozygous mutationsin the MEN1 tumour suppressor gene, located on chromosome\n11q13. The MEN1 gene encodes the menin protein involved in the\nregulation of gene transcription and mutation carriers will have clinicalmanifestations by the age of 50 years. The syndrome is associated\nwith parathyroid adenomas, duodenopancreatic NET and anterior\npituitary adenomas with a lifetime prevalence of 80% for NF-Pan-NET. MEN1 syndrome associates less frequently with thymic, lung\nand gastric NET and other tumours, and it is thus important to moni-\ntor patients for other neoplasms. Early recognition of relatives withMEN1 syndrome is of outmost importance due to 50% probability offirst line family members being carriers and also in the light of possible\ngenetic anticipation.\n84\nPan-NET arising in the context of MEN1 syndrome are usually\nmultiple, nonfunctioning and may develop early in the second decade\nof life.85The current state of evidence suggests initial close follow up\nwith MRI to assess growth rate alternating with EUS. SRI-PET may becarried out when it may change management such as in NF-Pan-NET\n>1 cm for detection of occult metastases or before interventions are\nconsidered.\n86,87\nSeveral studies have indicated that MEN1-associated NF-\nPan-NET usually exhibit a low propensity to grow and lesions <2 cm\ncan be simply followed up by observation. If they are NET G2-G3,have lymph node metastases and are >3 cm in diameter, surgical exci-sion is then considered as they may display metastatic potential.\n88For\nlesions between 2 and 3 cm there is uncertainty, and more studies are\nrequired prior to being able to make recommendations.', 'Patients with G3 NETs ( Table 2 ) have more aggressive\ndisease than the G1 and G2 NETs.

The primary end point was progression-free survival. Secondary end points included the objective response rate, overall survival, safety, and the side-effect profile. The final analysis of overall survival will be conducted in the future as specified in the protocol; a prespecified interim analysis of overall sur -\nvival was conducted and is reported here.\nRESULTS\nAt the data-cutoff date for the primary analysis, the estimated rate of progression-free survival at month 20 was 65.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 50.0 to 76.8) in the \n177Lu-\nDotatate group and 10.8% (95% CI, 3.5 to 23.0) in the control group. The response rate was 18% in the \n177Lu-Dotatate group versus 3% in the control group (P<0.001). In the \nplanned interim analysis of overall survival, 14 deaths occurred in the 177Lu-Dotatate \ngroup and 26 in the control group (P\n =\n 0\n.004). Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, thrombocyto -\npenia, and lymphopenia occurred in 1%, 2%, and 9%, respectively, of patients in the \n177Lu-Dotatate group as compared with no patients in the control group, with no evidence \nof renal toxic effects during the observed time frame.\nCONCLUSIONS\nTreatment with 177Lu-Dotatate resulted in markedly longer progression-free survival and \na significantly higher response rate than high-dose octreotide LAR among patients with advanced midgut neuroendocrine tumors. Preliminary evidence of an overall survival benefit was seen in an interim analysis; confirmation will be required in the planned final analysis. Clinically significant myelosuppression occurred in less than 10% of patients in the \n177Lu-Dotatate group.

Methods: Eligible pts were newly diagnosed with\nsomatostatin receptor-positive high G2 or G3 (Ki-67 $10% and #55%) advanced GEP-NETs\nwithin the last 6 months prior to enrollment. Pts were randomized (2:1) to receive 4 cycles of\n177Lu-DOTATATE (4 37.4 GBq) plus 30 mg octreotide long-acting release (LAR) at 8-weekly\nintervals during177Lu-DOTATATE treatment then every 4 weeks (177Lu-DOTATATE arm), or\n60 mg octreotide LAR every 4 weeks (control arm), stratified by grade (G2 vs G3) and tumororigin (pancreas vs other). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), centrally\nassessed using RECIST 1.1. Objective response rate (ORR), a key secondary endpoint, was tested\nhierarchically after PFS. Results: Overall, 226 pts were randomized to the\n177Lu-DOTATATE (n =\n151) or control (n = 75) arms.

24G advanced RAG,"Ist es möglich die verschiedenen Guidelines zu Management von neuroendokrinen Tumoren vergleichend darzustellen (ENETS, NANETS)? Wo sind hier die Unterschiede in der Therapie dieser Erkrankung? ",german,specific,guidelines,gpt-4o advanced RAG,"Es ist möglich, die verschiedenen Guidelines zum Management von neuroendokrinen Tumoren (NET) vergleichend darzustellen, insbesondere die von ENETS (European Neuroendocrine Tumor Society) und NANETS (North American Neuroendocrine Tumor Society). Die ENETS-Guidelines betonen die Bedeutung einer multidisziplinären Herangehensweise und die Nutzung von Peptid-Rezeptor-Radionuklid-Therapie (PRRT) nach Versagen der Erstlinientherapie bei progressiven SSTR-positiven NET (Pavel et al., 2016, S. 181). Sie empfehlen PRRT als Zweitlinientherapie bei midgut NET und als Drittlinientherapie nach Versagen von Everolimus. Zudem wird die Verwendung von SSA, Sunitinib und Everolimus in verschiedenen NET-Subtypen hervorgehoben (Pavel et al., 2016, S. 173).

Die NANETS-Guidelines hingegen legen ebenfalls Wert auf eine multidisziplinäre Behandlung, betonen jedoch stärker die Rolle von chirurgischen Eingriffen und systemischen Therapien wie SSA und zielgerichteten Therapien. Unterschiede in der Therapie können sich in der bevorzugten Reihenfolge der Behandlungsoptionen und der spezifischen Empfehlungen für bestimmte NET-Subtypen zeigen. Während ENETS PRRT nach Versagen der Erstlinientherapie empfiehlt, könnte NANETS andere systemische Therapien als bevorzugte Zweitlinientherapie vorschlagen.

Zusammenfassend lässt sich sagen, dass beide Guidelines ähnliche therapeutische Optionen bieten, jedoch Unterschiede in der Priorisierung und spezifischen Anwendung dieser Therapien bestehen.","['ENETS Consensus Guidelines Update for \nDistant Metastatic Disease  Neuroendocrinology 2016;103:172–185 \nDOI: 10.1159/000443167181in pancreatic NET and it may be considered in G3 NET and in \nhigh-risk NET of other primary site (e.g. pulmonary NET). In G3 NEC, platinum-based chemotherapy is recommended as a first-line therapy.\n  Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy\n  PRRT is a therapeutic option in progressive SSTR-pos-\nitive NET with homogenous SSTR expression (all lesions are positive). In general, the use of PRRT follows failed first-line medical therapy. Radionuclide therapy with ei-ther  \n90 Y and/or  177 Lu-labeled SSA is most frequently used \nin NET, but  177 Lu-labelled SSA is increasingly used due\nto lower kidney toxicity. The minimum requirementsfor PRRT are reported in a separate consensus guideline  \n[84] . Until recently, there were no results from prospec-\ntive randomized trials available. The registrational trialof  \n177 Lu-DOTATATE in progressive midgut NET\n(NETTER-1) has reached its primary endpoint with a sig-nificant prolongation of PFS compared to high-dose oc-treotide (60 mg/month). Based on this trial, and cumula-tive data from prospective and retrospective trials over the last 15 years, PRRT may be recommended in midgut NET as a second-line therapy after failure of SSA if the general requirements for applying PRRT are fulfilled  \n[84–\n87]  or as a third-line therapy after failure of everolimus. \n  Given the different established and approved therapeu-\ntic options in pancreatic NET and the lack of a prospective trial with PRRT in pancreatic NET, PRRT (if available) is in general recommended in G1/G2 NET after failure of medical therapy including SSA, chemotherapy or novel targeted drugs. However, potential increasing toxicity, e.g. after prior chemotherapy or targeted therapy, needs to be considered, requires close surveillance and might justify an earlier use of PRRT in selected patients ( table\xa01 ).\n  Minimal Consensus Statement \n \nPRRT is recommended after failure of medical therapy. Data \nfrom a prospective trial in midgut NET support its role as a second-line therapy option in intestinal NET if the general requirements for PRRT are fulfilled and as an alternative option to everolimus. The optimal sequencing with targeted drugs and/or chemotherapy needs to be defined in pancreatic NET when data from prospective randomized trials with PRRT in pancreatic NET become available.\n  Management of NET with Unknown Primary Tumor \n In approximately 13% of patients who are diagnosed \nas having NEN, the primary site is not known. In patients with unknown primary tumor, the site is most frequently localized in the intestine or the lung. Additional tools \nshould be exploited to identify the primary tumor. These include immunohistochemistry of transcription factors (CDX-2, Islet-1, TTF-1)  \n[88] , PET/CT (e.g.  Ga 68-SR,  11 C-\n5-hydroxytryptophan or  18 F-DOPA)  [89, 90]   and upper \nand lower gastrointestinal endoscopy and optionally cap-sule endoscopy  \n[91, 92]  . If the primary tumor site remains \nunknown, therapeutic decision making is essentially based on grading, functionality, SSTR status, tumor ex-tent and hepatic tumor burden.\n  Further information is provided in the consensus \nguideline updates for other GEP NET [ \n83, 93–97  , this is-\nsue].\n  Appendix \n All Other Vienna Consensus Conference Participants    \nAnlauf, M.

This is especially true for surgical treatment, different locoregional or ablative therapies [emboliza-tion, chemoembolization, radiofrequency ablation and selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT)] and system-ic chemotherapy. Somatostatin analogues (SSA) and novel targeted drugs, such as the multiple tyrosine ki-nase inhibitor sunitinib and the mTOR inhibitor evero-limus, are the only drugs that have been evaluated in NEN within placebo-controlled trials. Based on the re-sults of these trials, SSA, sunitinib and everolimus have been approved and registered for antiproliferative ther-apy in different neuroendocrine tumor (NET) subtypes excluding neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC). Recent data from a placebo-controlled trial with lanreotide (CLARINET study) in enteropancreatic NET have pro-vided novel evidence for the antiproliferative activity of SSA. Furthermore, it has recently been reported that \nthree large randomized controlled drug trials (i.e. evero-limus vs. placebo in lung and intestinal NET and NET of unknown primary tumor, RADIANT-4;  \n177 Lu-\nDOTATATE vs. high-dose octreotide in midgut NET, NETTER-1, and telotristat etiprate vs. placebo in refrac-tory carcinoid syndrome, TELESTAR) have reached their primary endpoints  \n[10–12]  . These well-construct-\ned phase III trials in NET have an impact on the current treatment recommendations and therapeutic algorithm. In addition, there is novel information available on the use of targeted drugs from application outside of ran-domized clinical trials. \n  Given the variety of treatment options, the heteroge-\nneity of NEN and the individual disease complexity, it is strongly recommended if not mandatory to discuss NEN patients after accurate imaging and pathology review in a multidisciplinary tumor board for appropriate therapeu-tic decision making, especially to exploit surgical therapy (a) Simple pattern of LMs\nG1/G2\n(unilobar or limited)Resection of primary\n(b) Complex pattern of LMs\nG1/G2\n(bilobar)Morphological and\nfunctional imaging\n(c) Diffuse LMs\nG1/G2\nOr surgery\ncontraindicated\nSurgery\ncontraindicatedResection\n(minor or\nanatomical)One-step surgery\nMajor liver\nresection ± RFATwo-step surgery(1) Minor resection   ± RFA, RPVE, RPVL\n(2) Sequential major\n   liver resectionSmall intestinal- SSA (IFN)- PRRT\n- EverolimusPancreatic\n- SSA (IFN)- Chemotherapy\n- Everolimus\n- Sunitinib\n- PRRTSelected cases\n(<1%)\nTACE, TAE\nSIRT*Ablation\n(RFA, LiTT)\nTACE, TAE\nSIRT*Liver\ntransplantation\n  Fig. 1.

Choosing antiproliferative therapies is also challenging depending on the tumor pri-mary, its functional status, its growth rate, grade and overall disease burden and the goal of individual thera-pies within the patient’s choice and status. Variation of treatment choices will also depend on physician exper-tise, the complexity of the treatment center and access to novel treatments. Recommendations for the preferential use of targeted drugs or chemotherapy as first-line thera-py are summarized in  table\xa01 .\n  This review focuses on intestinal and pancreatic NEN, \nand it provides a therapeutic algorithm for both subtypes ( fig.\xa02, 3 ). The management of typical and atypical lung NET is similar to that of gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) NEN taking into consideration pathological features (mi-totic count, Ki-67), somatostatin receptor (SSTR) expres-sion, growth rate and disease extent. The best practice recommendations for the management of typical and atypical bronchial NET are reported in a separate recent-ly published ENETS consensus paper  \n[13] .  Therapeutic Options \n In grade 1 (G1) and G2 NET, surgery with curative in-\ntent always has to be considered, even if liver and/ or lymph node metastases are present ( fig.\xa01 ). In non-resect-able disease, the following treatment options should be considered to control symptoms secondary to the hyper-secretion of peptide hormones/amines leading to a func-tional syndrome (carcinoid syndrome, diarrhea and oth-er symptoms related to functionally active pancreatic NEN) and/or tumor growth control.

24E advanced RAG,"Is it possible to compare the different guidelines for the management of neuroendocrine tumors (ENETS, NANETS)? Where are the differences in the therapy of this disease?",english,specific,guidelines,gpt-4o advanced RAG,"Yes, it is possible to compare the different guidelines for the management of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) provided by the European Neuroendocrine Tumor Society (ENETS) and the North American Neuroendocrine Tumor Society (NANETS). Both sets of guidelines offer comprehensive recommendations for the diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of NETs, but there are some differences in their approaches and specific recommendations.

ENETS guidelines emphasize the importance of a multidisciplinary tumor board for therapeutic decision-making, especially to exploit surgical therapy (Pavel et al., 2016). They provide detailed algorithms for the management of liver metastases, including options like surgery, radiofrequency ablation (RFA), transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), and selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT), which is still considered investigational (Pavel et al., 2016). ENETS also highlights the use of somatostatin analogues (SSA), sunitinib, and everolimus, which have been evaluated in placebo-controlled trials and approved for antiproliferative therapy in different NET subtypes (Pavel et al., 2016).

NANETS guidelines, while similar in many respects, may have different recommendations based on regional practices and available treatments. For instance, the use of specific drugs or therapeutic approaches might vary due to differences in drug approval status or clinical trial availability in North America compared to Europe.

In summary, while both ENETS and NANETS provide robust frameworks for managing NETs, differences may arise in specific therapeutic recommendations, the emphasis on certain treatment modalities, and the integration of new evidence from clinical trials.","[""1|INTRODUCTION\nThis ENETS guidance paper for the management of well-\ndifferentiated nonfunctioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours\n(NF-Pan-NET) aims to answer 10 major questions (Table 1) on the\nmanagement of these neoplasms.\nData were identified by MEDLINE database searches and expert\nopinion. Recommendations are given according to the best availableevidence and authors' experience and will have a level of evidence\n(1–5) and strength of recommendation (A –D) (Table\n2) as per the\nGRADE system.1\nThe incidence of Pan-NET is rising, most recently reported as\n0.48 per 100,000 new cases per year according to the Surveillance,\nEpidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Programme; although Pan-NET\ncarry an unfavourable prognosis compared to NET from other primarysites, an improvement in overall survival (OS) has been observed over\ntime (median OS of 3.6 years), particularly in patients with distant\nmetastases.\n2\nThe majority (between 50% and 85%) of Pan-NET are nonfunc-\ntioning. Moreover, NF-Pan-NET tend to present with more advanced\ndisease (more advanced tumour [T]-stage, lymph node involvementand liver metastases) and arise in the head of the pancreas. Conse-\nquently, patients with NF-Pan-NET have a significantly worse OS than\ntheir functioning counterparts ( p< .001).\n3,4\nIn patients undergoing curative resection, a shorter survival\nwas observed in patients with NF-Pan-NET, lymphatic invasion,\nand size >10 cm, while a shorter disease-free survival (DFS)\nwas associated with advanced pT-stage (pT3 –4), size >5 cm and\nhistological grade (G) 2 –3. Ki-67 > 10% predicted a poorer\nprognosis.52|DIAGNOSIS\n2.1 |Q1. How should we define and characterise a\nNF-Pan-NET at presentation?\nWhile the diagnosis of functionality relies on the presence of a\nhormonal syndrome, the NET-diagnosis relies on histological or cyto-\nlogical analysis. Histopathological diagnosis is based on the neuroen-docrine growth pattern, including nesting, trabecular, gyriform and\nsolid architecture, as well as the expression of neuroendocrine\nmarkers including synaptophysin and chromogranin A (CgA).\n6It should\nbe noted that in the pancreas, especially acinic cell carcinoma, solidpseudopapillary neoplasm and paraganglioma can be positive for\nthese markers, and therefore they should be actively excluded.\n7More\nrecently, the transcription factor INSM1 has emerged as a both sensi-tive and specific diagnostic mar ker of NET. Grading is assessed by\nTABLE 1 Ten major questions on management of nonfunctioning\npancreatic neuroendocrine tumours.\nQ1 How should we define and characterise a NF-Pan-NET\npatient at clinical presentation?\nQ2 Which biochemical tests should be performed in a patient\nwith NF-Pan-NET?\nQ3 Which is the most suitable imaging work-up for NF-Pan-NET\npatients?\nQ4 What is the appropriate surgical management of NF-Pan-\nNET?\nQ5 What is the role of PRRT in patiente with NF-Pan-NET?Q6 What is the role of biotherapy and molecular targeted\ntherapies in patients with advanced NF-Pan-NET?\nQ7 What is the role of chemotherapy in patients with advanced\nNF-Pan-NET?\nQ8 In the setting of advanced disease, which is the most suitable\nfirst-line systemic therapy? Which sequence of treatments\nshould be used?\nQ9 Is there a specific work-up in MEN1-associated NF-Pan-NET\npatients?\nQ10 What is the recommended follow-up in NF-Pan-NET\npatients?TABLE 2 Level of evidence and strength of recommendations."", 'Neuroendocrinology. \n2016;103(2):119-124.\n15.

This is especially true for surgical treatment, different locoregional or ablative therapies [emboliza-tion, chemoembolization, radiofrequency ablation and selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT)] and system-ic chemotherapy. Somatostatin analogues (SSA) and novel targeted drugs, such as the multiple tyrosine ki-nase inhibitor sunitinib and the mTOR inhibitor evero-limus, are the only drugs that have been evaluated in NEN within placebo-controlled trials. Based on the re-sults of these trials, SSA, sunitinib and everolimus have been approved and registered for antiproliferative ther-apy in different neuroendocrine tumor (NET) subtypes excluding neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC). Recent data from a placebo-controlled trial with lanreotide (CLARINET study) in enteropancreatic NET have pro-vided novel evidence for the antiproliferative activity of SSA. Furthermore, it has recently been reported that \nthree large randomized controlled drug trials (i.e. evero-limus vs. placebo in lung and intestinal NET and NET of unknown primary tumor, RADIANT-4;  \n177 Lu-\nDOTATATE vs. high-dose octreotide in midgut NET, NETTER-1, and telotristat etiprate vs. placebo in refrac-tory carcinoid syndrome, TELESTAR) have reached their primary endpoints  \n[10–12]  . These well-construct-\ned phase III trials in NET have an impact on the current treatment recommendations and therapeutic algorithm. In addition, there is novel information available on the use of targeted drugs from application outside of ran-domized clinical trials. \n  Given the variety of treatment options, the heteroge-\nneity of NEN and the individual disease complexity, it is strongly recommended if not mandatory to discuss NEN patients after accurate imaging and pathology review in a multidisciplinary tumor board for appropriate therapeu-tic decision making, especially to exploit surgical therapy (a) Simple pattern of LMs\nG1/G2\n(unilobar or limited)Resection of primary\n(b) Complex pattern of LMs\nG1/G2\n(bilobar)Morphological and\nfunctional imaging\n(c) Diffuse LMs\nG1/G2\nOr surgery\ncontraindicated\nSurgery\ncontraindicatedResection\n(minor or\nanatomical)One-step surgery\nMajor liver\nresection ± RFATwo-step surgery(1) Minor resection   ± RFA, RPVE, RPVL\n(2) Sequential major\n   liver resectionSmall intestinal- SSA (IFN)- PRRT\n- EverolimusPancreatic\n- SSA (IFN)- Chemotherapy\n- Everolimus\n- Sunitinib\n- PRRTSelected cases\n(<1%)\nTACE, TAE\nSIRT*Ablation\n(RFA, LiTT)\nTACE, TAE\nSIRT*Liver\ntransplantation\n  Fig. 1.

Patients with unresectable metastatic disease usually\ngo through multiple lines of treatments including somatostatin\nanalogue (SSA) therapy or targeted therapy, such as everoli-mus (mTOR inhibitor) or sunitinib (tyrosine kinase inhibitor)\n[7]. In patients with grade 1 and 2 NETs (Ki-7 LI of up to\n20%) that are inoperable and metastatic, who have failed first-\nline somatostatin treatment, and whose tumors express high\nlevels of somatostatin receptors (SSTRs), peptide receptor ra-\ndionuclide therapy (PRRT) would be a viable option. PRRTusually involves DOTATOC, DOTATATE, and DOTANOC\nlabeled either with\n90Yor177Lu [7]. Patients included in study\nprotocols have positive NET histology and SSTR scintigraphy\nwith111In OctreoScan or68Ga PET-Dota-peptide (Fig. 1). A\npositive scan denotes lesion uptake that is equal to or greaterthan the liver uptake [ 8]. Important criteria to be taken into\naccount when considering PRRT include objective disease\nprogression, adequate blood profile (hemoglobin, white cell,\nand platelet count levels), creatinine, and ECOG performancescore ≤2[8]. A good performance status means the patient\nwould be self-sufficient and reduces the need for physicalassistance during the treatment period (3 days/cycle).Recently published European Society for Medical Oncology\n(ESMO) Clinical Practice Guidelines have recommended\nPRRT up to the upper limit of Ki-67 LI to 30% [ 9].\nScintigraphic or PET tomoscintigraphic evaluation is to datethe most accurate noninvasive method to identify and confirmthe overexpression of functioning receptors [ 10]. An impor-\ntant issue in the consideration of PRRT is that the somatostatinreceptors should be functional, i.e., able to internalize the re-ceptor analogue complex and retain the radioactivity inside\nthe cell. The critical issues for effective therapy are somato-\nstatin receptor overexpression and the evidence of functional-ity. The nuclear physician can calculate a tumor-to-liver ratio\nas a relative measure of receptor number [ 11]; this ratio must\nbe high for PRRT eligibility.Mechanism of Action and Constituents\nof Radiolabeled SSAs\nSomatostatin ’s actions include inhibiting hormone secretion,\nsuppressing the release of insulin-like growth factors,\ninhibiting angiogenesis, and inducing apoptosis in the tumor\ntissue [ 12]. Such biologic effects are mediated through inter-\naction with five subtypes of somatostatin receptors (SSTR1-\n5), which belong to the seven-transmembrane domain, G-\nprotein-coupled receptor superfamily. The currently approvedSSAs are octreotide and lanreotide, in slow-release formula-\ntions, long-acting release (LAR), and supersaturated solution\n(Autogel®).\nDue to the overexpression of SSTRs in NETs, which is\nestimated to be in around 80% of NETs, they are consideredsuitable targets for PRRT with radiolabeled SSA. Once boundto their receptor, radiolabeled SSAs are internalized as per\nnormal receptor recycling dynamics, and the breakdown prod-\nucts of the radiolabeled peptides are stored in lysosomes, thusenabling delivery and causing suspension of radioactivity in-\nside the tumor cell [ 13]. This would result in radiation-induced\nDNA damage of the tumor cell and its eventual death.\nRadiolabeled SSAs are made up of three main constituents;\na radionuclide isotope, a ligand or carrier molecule (TOC or\nTATE), and a chelator or linker (DOTA) that binds them to-\ngether and stabilizes the complex (Fig. 2). Chelators mainly\nused include DOTA (tetraazacyclododecane tetra-acetic acid)\nand DTPA (diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid), while\noctreotide and octreotate (TOC and TATE, respectively) are\ngenerally used as ligands [ 14]. The most known and studied\nSSA is octreotide.']",1.0,0.75,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1.0,0.0,0.5,34

Their incidence and prevalence are continuously rising1. Current \nstandard treatment options for metastasized GEP-NETs include somatostatin (SST) \nanalogs (due to NETs strongly expressing SST receptors) and targeted drugs such \nas the mTOR inhibitor everolimus and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib. While \nthese treatments rarely induce objective tumor remission, disease stabilization may \nbe achieved for a limited time, for instance, median progression free survival (mPFS) \nwith everolimus in prospective phase III trials is 11 months2. Some patients may also \nbene/f_i  t from systemic chemotherapy.\nPeptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT) uses IV-infused radiolabeled ligands to \ndeliver cytotoxic dose of radiation to tumor cells while sparing the surrounding tissue. \nThis therapy is emerging as a promising option, providing more durable response and \npotentially higher objective response rates than currently approved therapies. PRRT \nwith 177Lu-DOTATATE has increased PFS and achieved higher response rates than high \ndose octreotide in patients with advanced SSTR+ midgut NETs3. These results call for \nadditional prospective, randomized and controlled study of other PRRTs in SSTR+ NETs \nof the midgut and other locations.\nLutetium (177Lu) edotreotide (177Lu-DOTATOC), tested in the COMPETE trial, is an \ninnovative octreotide-derived somatostatin analog containing the chelator DOTA \nradiolabeled with the medical radioisotope lutetium (177Lu).

Their incidence and prevalence are continuously rising1. Current \nstandard treatment options for metastasized GEP-NETs include somatostatin (SST) \nanalogs (due to NETs strongly expressing SST receptors) and targeted drugs such \nas the mTOR inhibitor everolimus and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib. While \nthese treatments rarely induce objective tumor remission, disease stabilization may \nbe achieved for a limited time, for instance, median progression free survival (mPFS) \nwith everolimus in prospective phase III trials is 11 months2. Some patients may also \nbene/f_i  t from systemic chemotherapy.\nPeptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT) uses IV-infused radiolabeled ligands to \ndeliver cytotoxic dose of radiation to tumor cells while sparing the surrounding tissue. \nThis therapy is emerging as a promising option, providing more durable response and \npotentially higher objective response rates than currently approved therapies. PRRT \nwith 177Lu-DOTATATE has increased PFS and achieved higher response rates than high \ndose octreotide in patients with advanced SSTR+ midgut NETs3. These results call for \nadditional prospective, randomized and controlled study of other PRRTs in SSTR+ NETs \nof the midgut and other locations.\nLutetium (177Lu) edotreotide (177Lu-DOTATOC), tested in the COMPETE trial, is an \ninnovative octreotide-derived somatostatin analog containing the chelator DOTA \nradiolabeled with the medical radioisotope lutetium (177Lu). Its favorable safety pro/f_i  le \nand promising eﬃ   cacy have been demonstrated in a phase II study in 56 patients4. \nLutetium (177Lu) edotreotide PRRT in metastasized GEP-NETs achieved a median PFS \nof 34.5 months in patients who received ≥2 treatment cycles (Figures 1 and 2). The \nCOMPETE trial is the /f_i  rst to undertake a direct comparison of PRRT vs. an approved \ntherapeutic.\nMethod\nTrial design\nCOMPETE is a prospective, randomized, controlled, open-label, multi-center, phase III \nclinical trial to evaluate the eﬃ   cacy and safety of lutetium (177Lu) edotreotide PRRT \ncompared to targeted molecular therapy with everolimus in patients with inoperable,  \nprogressive,  somatostatin  receptor-positive  (SSTR+)  GEP-NETs.

Therefore, we have been working closely with the Technical University of\nMunich (TUM) (https://www.tum.de/en/) on a range of projects. Over the years, ITM and its subsidiaries\nhave established GMP manufacturing and a robust global supply network of innovative, first-in-class\nmedical radioisotopes (/products/radiopharmaceuticals-medical-radioisotopes/) and generator platforms for\na new generation of targeted cancer diagnostics and therapies.\nIn 2007, the subsidiary ITM Medical Isotopes GmbH (formerly: ITG Isotope Technologies Garching GmbH)\nwas founded, with the aim to develop and produce diagnostic and therapeutic radioisotopes. In 2009, we\ndeveloped our lead product, the highly pure therapeutic radioisotope no-carrier-added Lutetium-177, for\nwhich we received marketing authorization in 2016. N.c.a. Lu is also known under the brand name\nEndolucinBeta (/products/radiopharmaceuticals-medical-radioisotopes/endolucinbetar-nca-177lu-\nchloride/). In 2010, the production of the new generation, non-metallic Germanium-68/Gallium-68 Generator\nproducing Gallium-68 for tumor diagnostics via molecular imaging with PET/CT/MR began. To act as a ""one\nstop shop"" in the radiopharmaceutical field, we additionally produce all the Radiolabeling & Quality Control\nEquipment (/products/radiolabeling-quality-control-equipment/) required for the use and processing of\ndiagnostic and therapeutic radioisotopes, such as labeling modules and quality control solutions.\nTaking next strategic steps from being a provider of medical radioisotopes to being a biotechnology and\nradiopharmaceutical group of companies, ITM’s subsidiary ITM Solucin GmbH started an international\nPhase III Clinical Trial, known as COMPETE (https://www.itm-gep-net-trials.com/), in 2017.

Targeted \nradiopharmaceuticals are created by linking a therapeutic radioisotope to a targeting molecule (e.g., peptide, antibo dy, small molecule) that can precisely recognize tumor cells and bind to tumor -specific \ncharacteristics, like receptors on the tumor cell surface . As a result, the radioisotope accumulates at \nthe tumor site and decays, releasing a small amount of ionizing radiation, thereby destroying tumor  \ntissue . The highly precise localization enables targeted treatment with minimal impact to healthy \nsurrounding tissue.  \n \nAbout ITM -11 (n.c.a. \n177Lu-edotreotide ) \nITM-11, ITM’s therapeutic  radiopharmaceutical  candidate  being  investigated in the phase III clinical \nstudies COMPETE and COMPOSE,  consists of two components: the medical radioisotope no -carrier -\nadded lutetium -177 (n.c.a. 177Lu) and the targeting molecule e dotreotide, a synthetic form of the \npeptide hormone somatostatin that targets neuroendocrine tumor -specific receptors.  Edotreotide \nbinds to these receptors and places the medical radioisotope n.c.a. l utetium -177 directly onto the \ndiseased neuroendocrine cells so that it accumulates at the tumor site. N.c.a.  lutetium -177 is \ninternalized into the tumor cells and decays, releasing medical radiation (ionizing β -radiation) with a \nmaximum radius of 1.7 mm and destroying tumor  tissue . The highly precise localization can result in \nthe healthy tissue surrounding the targeted tumor being minimally affected.  \n ITM Isotope Technologie s Munich SE  \nITM, a radiopharmaceutical biotech company, is dedicated to providing the most precise cancer \nradiotherapeutics and diagnostics to meet the needs of patients, clinicians and our partners through \nexcellence in development, production and global supply.

Targeted \nradiopharmaceuticals are created by linking a therapeutic radioisotope to a targeting molecule (e.g., peptide, antibo dy, small molecule) that can precisely recognize tumor cells and bind to tumor -specific \ncharacteristics, like receptors on the tumor cell surface . As a result, the radioisotope accumulates at \nthe tumor site and decays, releasing a small amount of ionizing radiation, thereby destroying tumor  \ntissue . The highly precise localization enables targeted treatment with minimal impact to healthy \nsurrounding tissue.  \n \nAbout ITM -11 (n.c.a. \n177Lu-edotreotide ) \nITM-11, ITM’s therapeutic  radiopharmaceutical  candidate  being  investigated in the phase III clinical \nstudies COMPETE and COMPOSE,  consists of two components: the medical radioisotope no -carrier -\nadded lutetium -177 (n.c.a. 177Lu) and the targeting molecule e dotreotide, a synthetic form of the \npeptide hormone somatostatin that targets neuroendocrine tumor -specific receptors.  Edotreotide \nbinds to these receptors and places the medical radioisotope n.c.a. l utetium -177 directly onto the \ndiseased neuroendocrine cells so that it accumulates at the tumor site.

In radioimmunotherapy, the β-particle emitting isotopes 131I and 90Y have been employed in >95% of clinical radioimmunotherapy trials (155,156). Proteins labeled with 131I however, degrade quickly when endocytosed in tumor cells and result in the release of 131I-tyrosine and free 131I into the blood stream (157). In general the use of 131I in PRRT has not been particularly successful. Bakker et al. for instance reported on the extensive radiolytic decomposition of octreotide for therapeutic doses of 131I-labeled octreotide for therapy of neuroendocrine tumors (158). Clinical trials of 177Lu and 67Cu (159-161) as well as current and clinical prospects of therapeutic radionuclides in nuclear medicine can be found in the literature (162-164).  Regarding CXCR4, various CXCR4 antagonists have been developed and some are investigated as anticancer agents (165). The majority of these agents aim towards blocking the CXCR4 receptor, hence interfering in cell migration processes and positively affecting overall survival. Nevertheless, the effect on tumor growth by antagonizing CXCR4 alone has only a negligible effect and is more efficient with combined chemotherapy. Throughout the thesis, several new pentixafor-based imaging agents for CXCR4 were developed. Selected structural modifications of the pentixafor scaffold lead to pentixather (cyclo(-D-Tyr(3-I)-N-Me-D-Orn(AMB, DOTA)-L-Arg-L-2-Nal-Gly-)), which provides a molecular scaffold with higher flexibility towards structural modifications (166,167). Pentixather labeled with potential nuclides for endoradiotherapy (e.g. 90Y, 177Lu, 213Bi) showed high receptor affinities  (chapter III.6 and appendix) and [90Y/177Lu]pentixather already demonstrated promising results in patients with multiple myeloma (167).

The following iodine isotopes may be used as \ntheranostic agents (12,14):\n131I is a dual ( β- and γ-ray) emitting isotope with \na low cost and long half-life (~8 days) that is used \nfor therapy and whole-body diagnostic scanning to \nidentify remnant thyroid tissue or metastatic thy -\nroid cancer. However, it is not an ideal diagnostic \nagent owing to its γ-ray emission pattern and long \nhalf-life, which result in poor image quality and a \nrelatively high patient radiation dose.\n123I, a purely γ-ray emitter, has a more optimal \nphysical profile than 131I for diagnostic purposes \nin that it yields better image quality and involves \na lower radiation burden. Thus, this isotope is \nalso well suited for use in more recent approaches \nsuch as tomographic (SPECT) and hybrid imag-\ning in conjunction with CT (SPECT/CT). For \nthese reasons, despite its higher cost compared \nwith 131I, 123I is the most used iodine radioisotope \nfor diagnostic scintigraphy in the United States.\nIodine 124 (124I), a promising diagnostic agent, \nis a positron emitter and is therefore used in PET. \nIt is less frequently used clinically owing to its \neven higher production cost and lack of wide-\nspread availability.\nIn terms of therapeutic applications, radio-\niodine therapy with 131I remains the modality of \nchoice for treating patients with differentiated \nthyroid cancer in the postoperative setting. 131I \ntherapy can be performed by using different pro-\ntocols for different purposes, taking into account \nfactors such as initial extent of disease, surgical \nspecimen characteristics, histologic subtype, im-\naging findings, and biochemical changes, which ultimately determine the risk of disease recur-\nrence. The applications for 131I therapy, which \nmay be superimposed in the same patient, consist \nof ablation of residual normal tissue, adjuvant \ntreatment of occult disease, and treatment of \nknown local-regional or, especially, metastatic \ndisease. Posttreatment images can be acquired in \naddition to pretreatment images, which, owing to \nthe higher activity of 131I used in therapy, provide \nhigher sensitivity in the assessment of metastatic \nlesions and overall staging, particularly in cases \nof small metastatic lesions such as micronodular \nlung metastases (15). The example case in Figure \n5 illustrates the difference between pre- and post-\ntreatment images (15–17).\n131I-MIBG for Neural Crest–derived \nTumors\nRationale and Clinical Aspects.— The molecular \nanalog of norepinephrine, MIBG labeled with 131I \n(131I-MIBG), is another classic theranostic agent \nthat is suitable for gamma  camera and SPECT \nimaging, and it has been used in clinical settings \nsince 1981. 131I-MIBG enters the neuroendocrine \ncells of the sympathetic nervous system by means \nof endocytosis or diffusion and remains stored \nin neurosecretory vesicles. It has high sensitivity \n(>90%) and specificity (>95%) for the detec-\ntion of neural crest–derived (neuroectodermic) \ntumors and their secondary lesions (particularly \nin neuroblastoma, pheochromocytoma, and \nparaganglioma), complementing conventional \nimaging and indicating which tumors may benefit \nfrom radioisotopic therapy (12,18).\nLike radioiodine, 123I-MIBG facilitates better \nimaging and is suitable for SPECT and SPECT/\nCT, but at a higher cost. Recent improvements \nin SPECT/CT techniques include the use of 124I-\nMIBG for PET, which yields higher spatial reso-\nlution and accuracy. Both 123I-MIBG and 124I-\nMIBG are limited to use for diagnostic purposes \nonly, serving as imaging tracers, while 131I-MIBG \nis predominately used for therapeutics (19).', 'to\xa0 [68Ga]Ga- DOTA-TATE\xa0or DOTA-TOC. However, 90Y \nis also occasionally therapeutic, as are fluorine-18 (18F)- \nand technetium-99\xa0m (99mTc)-labelled diagnostic com -\npounds. Table\xa0 1 summarises the main properties of these \nradionuclides.\nWith 177Lu, attention must be paid to the underlying man -\nufacturing pathway, which may result in unwanted long-lived \naccompanying nuclides that require special consideration in \nterms of storage and disposal of waste depending on local \nregulations. 177Lu is made either by direct neutron irradiation \nof 176Lu targets (176Lu (n,γ) reaction) or indirectly as a decay \nproduct of the neutron irradiation of ytterbium-176 (176Yb \n(n,γ) reaction), which produces 177Yb that decays to 177Lu. \nIn the indirect reaction, no long-lived contaminants are cre -\nated. However, in the direct reaction, small quantities of \nmetastable lutetium-177 (177mLu) with a half-life of 161\xa0days \nmay be present [ 7]. In this case, 177mLu may account for \napproximately 0.02% of the total amount of 177Lu in the final \nradiopharmaceutical. 68\xa0Ga may either be obtained from a \nradionuclide generator (68Ge/68\xa0Ga-generator) or produced \nby proton irradiation of zinc-68 (68Zn(p,n)68\xa0Ga). The differ -\nent production pathways of the radionuclides are associated \nwith different radionuclidic impurities that must be taken \ninto account, i.e. germanium-68 and gallium-67, respectively \n[8]. The 90Y currently available for radiolabelling is of high \nradionuclidic purity with no relevant amounts of accompa -\nnying nuclides [ 9]. Long-lived radioactive contaminants may \nrequire specific regulatory attention.Radiation protection and\xa0shielding\nShielding of syringes and vials, as well as in some jurisdic -\ntions, waste and storage containers, is an important aspect \nof reducing external exposure among staff, the public and \npatients. After administration of the radiopharmaceutical, \nit may be necessary (mainly in Europe, and in some cases \nin the USA depending on exposure rates) to isolate the \npatient from other persons, either within the hospital or in \nthe public domain. The type of radiation emitted from the \ntheranostics compound will dictate the extent of shield -\ning required. This can vary from PMMA (polymethyl \nmetacrylate) storage boxes for vials and waste containers, \nlead pots and tungsten syringe shields, to concrete waste \nbunkers or lead-lined treatment rooms. This infrastructure \nmust be prepared according to local regulation and must be \nin place before any activity involving radiation is carried \nout. Appropriateness of the control measures must also be \ndemonstrated, usually in the form of a written radiation \nrisk assessment that considers radiation protection of both \nemployees and patients. Established risk analysis methods \nsuch as failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) or fault \ntree analysis (FTA) should be used for this purpose. Com -\npliance with NRC and/or state radiation safety regulations \nis required in the US.\nTable  1  Physical characteristics of the commonly used theranostics pairs 68\xa0Ga/177Lu and 68\xa0Ga/90Y\n* Data are extracted from The Lund/LBNL Nuclear Data Search V 2.0 ( http://  nucle  ardata.  nucle  ar. lu.']",2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,1.0,0.0,0.5,18

This optimum reflected the 64.2- hour \nhalf- life of yttrium-90 and its high- energy β- particle, \nwhich was deemed favourable for uniformly irradiating \ntumours. Like iodine-131, the adoption of yttrium-90 for RPT is likely based on its history and widespread availability. In the 1970s it was used in colloidal form, \nprimarily to treat rheumatoid conditions\n33,34. Efforts to \nconjugate yttrium-90, a radiometal, were unsuccessful35 \nuntil a radiometal conjugation chemistry that retained stability in\xa0vivo was developed\n36,37. Clinical trials using \nyttrium-90- labelled antibodies as RPT agents initially \nfocused on ovarian cancer38,39 and subsequently on \nhaematological cancers40–42, as well as radiopeptide  \ntherapy43. Yttrium-90 continues to be a popular radio-\nnuclide for RPT because of the clinical impact of yttrium-90- impregnated microspheres that are used \nfor treatment of hepatic metastases\n44–48. Although \nyttrium-90 has been imaged, imaging generally requires high \nactivities  (more than 300 MBq)49. Such activities \nare typically achieved only in microsphere therapies. Lutetium-177 gained popularity because it emits pho-\ntons in the 100–200-keV optimal imaging range and has a β-particle energy appropriate for therapy. These factors, along with a half- life that is compatible with the \npharmacokinetics of both antibodies and peptides, make this radionuclide a \ntheranostic  in that the same radio-\nnuclide may be used to assess tumour uptake and the \nextent of cancer, and also as a treatment50. It is produced \nin a reactor and is therefore widely available51, with a \nrelatively straightforward conjugation chemistry52.\nα- Particles are helium nuclei (two protons and two \nneutrons) that are emitted from the nucleus of a radio -\nactive atom. Depending on their emission energy, they  \ncan travel 50–100 µm in tissue. They are positively \ncharged and are orders of magnitude larger than electrons. \nThe amount of energy deposited per path length trav-\nelled (designated ‘linear energy transfer’) of α- particles \nis approximately 400 times greater than that of electrons.  \nThis leads to substantially more damage along their \npath than that caused by electrons. An α- particle track \nleads to a preponderance of complex and largely irrep-\narable DNA double- strand breaks53,54. The absorbed \ndose required to achieve cytotoxicity relates to the \nnumber of α-  particles traversing the cell nucleus. With use of this as a measure, cytotoxicity may be achieved \nwith a range of 1 to 20 α- particle traversals of the cell \nnucleus53. The resulting high potency, combined with \nthe short range of α- particles (which reduces normal \norgan toxicity), has led to substantial commercial inter -\nest in developing α- particle- emitting RPT agents55. The \nα- particle emitters introduced and used for RPT over \nthe last 40 years include astatine-211, bismuth-212, lead-212, bismuth-213, actinium-225, radium-223 and thorium-227 \n(fIG.\xa0 2b; TAbLeS\xa0 1,2).\nThe α- particle- emitting RPT agent radium-223 \ndichloride (Xofigo) was approved by the FDA in May 2013. At the time it was approved, effective therapies for patients with castration- resistant prostate cancer \nthat had metastasized to bone did not exist. The very \nencouraging clinical trial results\n56 and the subsequent \nFDA approval were instrumental in the renewed inter -\nest in RPT, in general, and α- emitter RPT, in particu-\nlar. Subsequently, individual- patient demonstrations \nof α- emitter potency have reinforced the interest in \nα- particle- emitting RPT57,58. Overall, there has been an \nalmost sixfold increase in the number of studies related to α-  emitters for RPT over the past 10 years.', 'RG • Volume 40  Number 6  Gomes Marin et al  1719\n131I.

The example case in Figure \n5 illustrates the difference between pre- and post-\ntreatment images (15–17).\n131I-MIBG for Neural Crest–derived \nTumors\nRationale and Clinical Aspects.— The molecular \nanalog of norepinephrine, MIBG labeled with 131I \n(131I-MIBG), is another classic theranostic agent \nthat is suitable for gamma  camera and SPECT \nimaging, and it has been used in clinical settings \nsince 1981. 131I-MIBG enters the neuroendocrine \ncells of the sympathetic nervous system by means \nof endocytosis or diffusion and remains stored \nin neurosecretory vesicles. It has high sensitivity \n(>90%) and specificity (>95%) for the detec-\ntion of neural crest–derived (neuroectodermic) \ntumors and their secondary lesions (particularly \nin neuroblastoma, pheochromocytoma, and \nparaganglioma), complementing conventional \nimaging and indicating which tumors may benefit \nfrom radioisotopic therapy (12,18).\nLike radioiodine, 123I-MIBG facilitates better \nimaging and is suitable for SPECT and SPECT/\nCT, but at a higher cost. Recent improvements \nin SPECT/CT techniques include the use of 124I-\nMIBG for PET, which yields higher spatial reso-\nlution and accuracy. Both 123I-MIBG and 124I-\nMIBG are limited to use for diagnostic purposes \nonly, serving as imaging tracers, while 131I-MIBG \nis predominately used for therapeutics (19).']",3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,1.0,0.0,0.5,19

Patients with unresectable metastatic disease usually\ngo through multiple lines of treatments including somatostatin\nanalogue (SSA) therapy or targeted therapy, such as everoli-mus (mTOR inhibitor) or sunitinib (tyrosine kinase inhibitor)\n[7]. In patients with grade 1 and 2 NETs (Ki-7 LI of up to\n20%) that are inoperable and metastatic, who have failed first-\nline somatostatin treatment, and whose tumors express high\nlevels of somatostatin receptors (SSTRs), peptide receptor ra-\ndionuclide therapy (PRRT) would be a viable option.

Patients included in study\nprotocols have positive NET histology and SSTR scintigraphy\nwith111In OctreoScan or68Ga PET-Dota-peptide (Fig. 1). A\npositive scan denotes lesion uptake that is equal to or greaterthan the liver uptake [ 8]. Important criteria to be taken into\naccount when considering PRRT include objective disease\nprogression, adequate blood profile (hemoglobin, white cell,\nand platelet count levels), creatinine, and ECOG performancescore ≤2[8]. A good performance status means the patient\nwould be self-sufficient and reduces the need for physicalassistance during the treatment period (3 days/cycle).Recently published European Society for Medical Oncology\n(ESMO) Clinical Practice Guidelines have recommended\nPRRT up to the upper limit of Ki-67 LI to 30% [ 9].\nScintigraphic or PET tomoscintigraphic evaluation is to datethe most accurate noninvasive method to identify and confirmthe overexpression of functioning receptors [ 10]. An impor-\ntant issue in the consideration of PRRT is that the somatostatinreceptors should be functional, i.e., able to internalize the re-ceptor analogue complex and retain the radioactivity inside\nthe cell. The critical issues for effective therapy are somato-\nstatin receptor overexpression and the evidence of functional-ity. The nuclear physician can calculate a tumor-to-liver ratio\nas a relative measure of receptor number [ 11]; this ratio must\nbe high for PRRT eligibility.Mechanism of Action and Constituents\nof Radiolabeled SSAs\nSomatostatin ’s actions include inhibiting hormone secretion,\nsuppressing the release of insulin-like growth factors,\ninhibiting angiogenesis, and inducing apoptosis in the tumor\ntissue [ 12]. Such biologic effects are mediated through inter-\naction with five subtypes of somatostatin receptors (SSTR1-\n5), which belong to the seven-transmembrane domain, G-\nprotein-coupled receptor superfamily. The currently approvedSSAs are octreotide and lanreotide, in slow-release formula-\ntions, long-acting release (LAR), and supersaturated solution\n(Autogel®).\nDue to the overexpression of SSTRs in NETs, which is\nestimated to be in around 80% of NETs, they are consideredsuitable targets for PRRT with radiolabeled SSA. Once boundto their receptor, radiolabeled SSAs are internalized as per\nnormal receptor recycling dynamics, and the breakdown prod-\nucts of the radiolabeled peptides are stored in lysosomes, thusenabling delivery and causing suspension of radioactivity in-\nside the tumor cell [ 13]. This would result in radiation-induced\nDNA damage of the tumor cell and its eventual death.\nRadiolabeled SSAs are made up of three main constituents;\na radionuclide isotope, a ligand or carrier molecule (TOC or\nTATE), and a chelator or linker (DOTA) that binds them to-\ngether and stabilizes the complex (Fig. 2). Chelators mainly\nused include DOTA (tetraazacyclododecane tetra-acetic acid)\nand DTPA (diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid), while\noctreotide and octreotate (TOC and TATE, respectively) are\ngenerally used as ligands [ 14].

33E advanced RAG,How does PRRT work/what is the drug made up of?,english,general,mechanism of action,gpt-4o advanced RAG,"Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT) works by using radiolabeled somatostatin analogues (SSAs) that target somatostatin receptors (SSTRs) on tumor cells. These receptors are overexpressed in many neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). The radiopharmaceutical, such as ^177Lu-DOTATATE, binds to the SSTRs and is internalized into the tumor cells. Inside the cells, the radiopharmaceutical emits beta radiation, causing DNA damage that leads to tumor cell death (Camus et al., 2021; Hirmas et al., 2018; Cancers, 2022).

The drug is composed of three main components: a radionuclide isotope (e.g., ^177Lu, ^90Y, or ^111In), a ligand or carrier molecule (e.g., octreotide or octreotate), and a chelator (e.g., DOTA or DTPA) that binds the radionuclide to the ligand and stabilizes the complex (Camus et al., 2021; Hirmas et al., 2018).","['If GEP-NETS are resectable, surgery is the primary ap-\nproach.

For many years, evidence of an anti-tumor effect of PRRT were only obtained from\nnon-randomized Phase II trials or retrospective studies. The NETTER-1 Phase III Random-\nized Trial finally validated this treatment option by confirming its low toxicity but also its\neffectiveness in tumor control. Following these results,177Lu-DOTATATE was approved by\nthe US Food and Drug Administration in 2018 and the European Medicines Agency in 2017\nfor the treatment of gastroenteropancreatic NETs that are well differentiated and obtain a\nprescription authorization in France in metastatic midgut NETs [ 2]. Some interesting data\nexist for pancreatic and pulmonary NETs. In this review, we discuss the clinical efficiency of\nPRRT in gastroenteropancreatic and pulmonary NETs.\n2. Somatostatin Receptors (SSTR) and Radio-Labelled Somatostatin Analogues\nEffect of PRRT is correlated with the ability for the markers to ﬁx the SSTR (SSTR1-5).\nThis therapy is therefore dedicated to NETs who strongly over expressed those receptors.\nSSTRs belong to a family of G-protein coupled receptors with seven transmembrane\ndomains. The majority of well differentiated gastroenteropancreatic and pulmonary NETs\nare characterized by the strong expression of SSTR, including SSTR2 Grade 1/2 NETs\nexpress the SSTR more often and at higher levels than grade 3 NETs. When linked to the\nreceptors, radiolabeled somatostatin analogues are internalized according to the normal\nrecycling dynamics of membrane receptors and the degradation products of peptides\nare stored in lysosomes, in intracellular, which allows for the release and retention of\nradioactivity inside tumor cells [ 3]. This mechanism accounts for the low toxicity of the\nPRRT on the healthy cells. Radiolabelled somatostatin analogs are made up of an isotope\nradionuclide, a carrier molecule (derived from octreotide), and a chelating agent that binds\nthem together and stabilizes the complex. The commonly used chelating agents are DOTA\n(DOTA acid and tetra-azacyclododecane-tetra-acetic) and DTPA (di-ethylenetriamine penta-\naceticacid). Three radionucleides (111In,90Y and177Lu) were conjugated to the somatostatin\nanalogues and their different physical characteristics confer speciﬁc advantages. The90Y\nand177Lu emit beta particles with higher energy and longer ranges, which translates into\ngreater therapeutic potential. Due to the emission of gamma rays, the177Lu can also be\nused for dosimetry and monitoring of tumor response [4].\n3. Modalities of Realization and Patients Selection\nPRRT is the single validated treatment option in the NETs, which for there is a pre-\ndictive marker of answer: the expression of SSTR. Response rates have been shown to\nbe increased in patients with a higher degree of absorption of radiotracers in the case of\n111In-pentetreotid scintigraphy An overall response rate of approximately 60% has been\nreported in patients with a grade 4 according to the Krenning score, corresponding to a tu-\nmor absorption greater than that of the spleen, and kidneys. Intense ﬁxation (SUV) greater\nthan 16 on the68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT is a predictive marker of high tumor response\n(sensitivity: 95%; specﬁcity: 60 %) [ 5] (Figure 1). The effectiveness of PRRT is correlated\nwith the tumor volume and the location of the primary tumor (amount of SSTR present\non the tumor cell) (Figure 2). Thus, NETs with high liver tumor volume are considered\nto be less sensitive to PRRT [ 6]. Similarly, it is suggested that pancreatic NETs frequently\nrespond to the PRRT but with an earlier progression than in midgut NETs. The treatment\nmodalities are relatively standardized in France with a treatment carried out by infusion\nof radiolabel split in four cycles spaced eight weeks apart.']",4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1.0,1.0,1.0,123

Currently, the randomized phase III COMPETE trial is comparing\nPRRT with177Lu-edotreotide with everolimus in advanced, progressive GEP-NET patients.\nA subset of GEP-NET patients present with extensive tumor bulk or high proliferative rate\n(Ki-67 index of 10–55%). In these cases, treatment with octreotide LAR or lanreotide has\nquestionable antiproliferative effects [ 71]. Given its ORR of 39%, which increases to 55% in\npanNETs [ 29],177Lu-DOTATATE can be considered as ﬁrst-line therapy if response is clini-\ncally necessitated [ 72]. These response rates compare favorably to targeted therapy [ 73–75]\nand for panNETs appear similar to capecitabine–temozolomide chemotherapy [ 76]. Poorly\ndifferentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs) and well-differentiated grade 3 NETs\nare high-grade NENs that display a more aggressive biological behavior than the more\ncommon grade 1 and 2 NETs [ 77]. PRRT is currently not considered a standard treatment\noption for high-grade NENs [68,78]. The rate of SSTR 2expression in grade 3 NETs ranges\nfrom 67–92% and in NECs from 32–50%, compared to a positive expression rate in grade 1\nand 2 NETs ranging from 67–96% [ 5,79–82]. In a meta-analysis of PRRT comprising four\nstudies, grade 3 NET patients had a median PFS of 19 months and median OS of 44 months\nafter PRRT. The median PFS was 11 and 4 months and the median OS was 22 and 9 months\nfor NEC with a Ki-67 of 21–55% and NEC with a Ki-67 above 55%, respectively [ 83]. Recent\nstudies implicated that PRRT could be considered in grade 3 GEP-NETs and GEP-NEC\nwith a Ki-67 of 21–55%. Importantly, to qualify for PRRT, uptake in all lesions is required\non somatostatin receptor imaging [83].\n7. Eligibility Criteria for PRRT\nThere are several inclusion and exclusion criteria to decide if a patient is eligible for\ntreatment with PRRT. A key criterion for PRRT is the degree of uptake on SSTR imaging\nwhich is scored by the Krenning score based on planar111In-DTPA-octereotide imaging.\nIt was reported that68Ga-DOTA-SSA PET/CT results in higher Krenning scores than\n111In-DTPA-octereotide imaging [ 84]. The uptake of all tumor lesions should minimally\nbe equal to the physiological uptake in the liver (Krenning score grade 2) on111In-DTPA-\noctreotide scintigraphy or higher than the physiological uptake in the liver on68Ga-DOTA-\nSSA PET/CT for a patient to be eligible for PRRT. The latter functional imaging is more\naccurate for detecting SSTR-positive primary tumors and metastases and therefore su-\nperior for assessing the total extent of disease [ 85–87]. PRRT is only applicable for pa-\ntients with a Karnofsky Performance Scale of at least 60 [ 27]. PRRT is contra-indicated\nfor patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding, patients with severe cardiac impairment\n(NYHA III or IV) and those with a life expectancy less than 3 months [ 31]. Since PRRT\ncan induce toxicity, the following pre-treatment laboratory values are required: creatinine\nclearance > 40 mL/min, hemoglobin levels ≥6 mmol/L, leukocytes > 2 ×109/L, platelet\ncount > 75 ×109/L, bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) and aspartate aminotrans-\nferase (ASAT) < 3 times the upper limit of normal and albumin > 3 g/dL [2,3].\n8.', 'If GEP-NETS are resectable, surgery is the primary ap-\nproach. Patients with unresectable metastatic disease usually\ngo through multiple lines of treatments including somatostatin\nanalogue (SSA) therapy or targeted therapy, such as everoli-mus (mTOR inhibitor) or sunitinib (tyrosine kinase inhibitor)\n[7]. In patients with grade 1 and 2 NETs (Ki-7 LI of up to\n20%) that are inoperable and metastatic, who have failed first-\nline somatostatin treatment, and whose tumors express high\nlevels of somatostatin receptors (SSTRs), peptide receptor ra-\ndionuclide therapy (PRRT) would be a viable option. PRRTusually involves DOTATOC, DOTATATE, and DOTANOC\nlabeled either with\n90Yor177Lu [7]. Patients included in study\nprotocols have positive NET histology and SSTR scintigraphy\nwith111In OctreoScan or68Ga PET-Dota-peptide (Fig. 1). A\npositive scan denotes lesion uptake that is equal to or greaterthan the liver uptake [ 8]. Important criteria to be taken into\naccount when considering PRRT include objective disease\nprogression, adequate blood profile (hemoglobin, white cell,\nand platelet count levels), creatinine, and ECOG performancescore ≤2[8]. A good performance status means the patient\nwould be self-sufficient and reduces the need for physicalassistance during the treatment period (3 days/cycle).Recently published European Society for Medical Oncology\n(ESMO) Clinical Practice Guidelines have recommended\nPRRT up to the upper limit of Ki-67 LI to 30% [ 9].\nScintigraphic or PET tomoscintigraphic evaluation is to datethe most accurate noninvasive method to identify and confirmthe overexpression of functioning receptors [ 10]. An impor-\ntant issue in the consideration of PRRT is that the somatostatinreceptors should be functional, i.e., able to internalize the re-ceptor analogue complex and retain the radioactivity inside\nthe cell. The critical issues for effective therapy are somato-\nstatin receptor overexpression and the evidence of functional-ity. The nuclear physician can calculate a tumor-to-liver ratio\nas a relative measure of receptor number [ 11]; this ratio must\nbe high for PRRT eligibility.Mechanism of Action and Constituents\nof Radiolabeled SSAs\nSomatostatin ’s actions include inhibiting hormone secretion,\nsuppressing the release of insulin-like growth factors,\ninhibiting angiogenesis, and inducing apoptosis in the tumor\ntissue [ 12]. Such biologic effects are mediated through inter-\naction with five subtypes of somatostatin receptors (SSTR1-\n5), which belong to the seven-transmembrane domain, G-\nprotein-coupled receptor superfamily. The currently approvedSSAs are octreotide and lanreotide, in slow-release formula-\ntions, long-acting release (LAR), and supersaturated solution\n(Autogel®).\nDue to the overexpression of SSTRs in NETs, which is\nestimated to be in around 80% of NETs, they are consideredsuitable targets for PRRT with radiolabeled SSA. Once boundto their receptor, radiolabeled SSAs are internalized as per\nnormal receptor recycling dynamics, and the breakdown prod-\nucts of the radiolabeled peptides are stored in lysosomes, thusenabling delivery and causing suspension of radioactivity in-\nside the tumor cell [ 13]. This would result in radiation-induced\nDNA damage of the tumor cell and its eventual death.\nRadiolabeled SSAs are made up of three main constituents;\na radionuclide isotope, a ligand or carrier molecule (TOC or\nTATE), and a chelator or linker (DOTA) that binds them to-\ngether and stabilizes the complex (Fig. 2). Chelators mainly\nused include DOTA (tetraazacyclododecane tetra-acetic acid)\nand DTPA (diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid), while\noctreotide and octreotate (TOC and TATE, respectively) are\ngenerally used as ligands [ 14]. The most known and studied\nSSA is octreotide.', '&A patient with pending liver failure should be consid-\nered with caution before being submitted to PRRNT.\nProcedure\nPretherapy assessment\nThe availability of the following information is mandatory\nwhen considering a patient for PRRNT:\n&NET proven by histopathology (immunohistochemistry).\n&High sstr expression determined by functional whole-\nbody imaging with111In-pentetreotide (OctreoScan) or68\nGa-DOTA-peptide PET/CT or immunohistochemistry.\nThe following criteria should be taken into consideration\nwhen deciding whether or not to perform PRRNT.\n&Karnofsky/Lansky performance status above 60 % or\nECOG performance status less than 2.\n&Tumour differentiation, preferably grade 1/2.\n&Tumour proliferation rate, preferably with a Ki-67/mitotic\nindex ≤20 %. In addition, the rate of tumour growth, as\ndetermined by CTor MRI, could be considered. Note that,in general, less-differentiated tumours showing high pro-\nliferation rates are better candidates for chemotherapy.\nFacility and personnel\nPRRNT is still considered an investigational treatment and\nits implementation must comply with national legislation\nand local requirements, as well as with ethical principles\nregarding human studies. The decision to provide PRRNTshould be taken within a multidisciplinary tumour board,\nincluding all the specialists involved in the care of patients\nwith NET. The facility requirements will depend on nationallegislation on the therapeutic use of radioactive agents. If\ninpatient therapy is required by national legislation, the\ntreatment should take place in an approved facility. Thefacility must have appropriate personnel, radiation safety\nequipment, and procedures for waste management and han-\ndling accidental contamination of the site or personnel.\n90Y-DOTATOC or177Lu-DOTATATE should be admin-\nistered by appropriately trained medical staff with support-\ning nursing staff with a medical physics expert available.\nPhysicians responsible for treating patients should have a\ngeneral knowledge of the pathophysiology and natural historyof the respective diseases, should be familiar with alternative\nforms of therapy, and should be able to closely liaise with\nother physicians involved in managing the patients. Cliniciansinvolved in the utilization of unsealed radionuclide sources for\ntherapy must also be knowledgeable about and compliant with\napplicable national legislation and local regulations.Patient preparation\nRenal protectionTogether with the bone marrow, the kidneys are the critical\norgans in PRRNT particularly when using\n90Y-DOTATOC.\nProximal tubular reabsorption of the radiopeptide and subse-\nquent retention in the interstitium result in excessive renal\nirradiation. Nephrotoxicity may be aggravated by risk factors,such as preexisting hypertension or diabetes mellitus [ 57]. To\ncounteract and reduce the high kidney retention of radiopep-\ntides, positively charged amino acids, such as\nL-lysine and/or\nL-arginine, are coinfused to competitively inhibit the proximal\ntubular reabsorption of the radiopeptide. The coadministration\nof these amino acids leads to a significant reduction in the\nrenal absorbed dose, which ranges from 9 % to 53 % [ 58].\nRenal absorbed dose is further reduced by up to 39 % byextending the infusion time of the amino acid solution over\n10 h, and up to 65 % by extending the protection over 2 days\nfollowing radiopeptide administration, thereby covering therenal elimination phase more efficiently [ 59,60].\nAmino acid protection protocols\nLysine and/or arginine should be diluted appropriately in\nlarge volumes of normal saline in order to hydrate thepatient, unless the patient suffers from cardiac insufficiency\n(e.g. carcinoid heart valve disease), in which case volume\noverload, possibly leading to acute exacerbation of the con-dition, should be avoided. Hyperosmotic solutions in partic-\nular should be avoided since they can induce dangerous\nelectrolyte imbalances that might lead to severe metabolicacidosis and cardiac arrhythmias. An appropriate dilution is\n25 g of amino acid in 1 l of normal saline.\nBefore beginning the amino acid infusion, appropriate\nmeasures against nausea and vomiting should be undertaken\nby administering an antiemetic (e.g. 5-HT3 antagonist, such as\ngranisetron) and/or a corticosteroid (e.g.']",2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1.0,1.0,1.0,64
34E advanced RAG,What is the major requirement for a patient to be treated with PRRT?,english,general,requirements,gpt-4o advanced RAG,"The major requirement for a patient to be treated with PRRT is the degree of uptake on somatostatin receptor (SSTR) imaging, which is scored by the Krenning score.

Currently, the randomized phase III COMPETE trial is comparing\nPRRT with177Lu-edotreotide with everolimus in advanced, progressive GEP-NET patients.\nA subset of GEP-NET patients present with extensive tumor bulk or high proliferative rate\n(Ki-67 index of 10–55%). In these cases, treatment with octreotide LAR or lanreotide has\nquestionable antiproliferative effects [ 71]. Given its ORR of 39%, which increases to 55% in\npanNETs [ 29],177Lu-DOTATATE can be considered as ﬁrst-line therapy if response is clini-\ncally necessitated [ 72]. These response rates compare favorably to targeted therapy [ 73–75]\nand for panNETs appear similar to capecitabine–temozolomide chemotherapy [ 76]. Poorly\ndifferentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs) and well-differentiated grade 3 NETs\nare high-grade NENs that display a more aggressive biological behavior than the more\ncommon grade 1 and 2 NETs [ 77]. PRRT is currently not considered a standard treatment\noption for high-grade NENs [68,78]. The rate of SSTR 2expression in grade 3 NETs ranges\nfrom 67–92% and in NECs from 32–50%, compared to a positive expression rate in grade 1\nand 2 NETs ranging from 67–96% [ 5,79–82]. In a meta-analysis of PRRT comprising four\nstudies, grade 3 NET patients had a median PFS of 19 months and median OS of 44 months\nafter PRRT. The median PFS was 11 and 4 months and the median OS was 22 and 9 months\nfor NEC with a Ki-67 of 21–55% and NEC with a Ki-67 above 55%, respectively [ 83]. Recent\nstudies implicated that PRRT could be considered in grade 3 GEP-NETs and GEP-NEC\nwith a Ki-67 of 21–55%. Importantly, to qualify for PRRT, uptake in all lesions is required\non somatostatin receptor imaging [83].\n7. Eligibility Criteria for PRRT\nThere are several inclusion and exclusion criteria to decide if a patient is eligible for\ntreatment with PRRT. A key criterion for PRRT is the degree of uptake on SSTR imaging\nwhich is scored by the Krenning score based on planar111In-DTPA-octereotide imaging.\nIt was reported that68Ga-DOTA-SSA PET/CT results in higher Krenning scores than\n111In-DTPA-octereotide imaging [ 84]. The uptake of all tumor lesions should minimally\nbe equal to the physiological uptake in the liver (Krenning score grade 2) on111In-DTPA-\noctreotide scintigraphy or higher than the physiological uptake in the liver on68Ga-DOTA-\nSSA PET/CT for a patient to be eligible for PRRT. The latter functional imaging is more\naccurate for detecting SSTR-positive primary tumors and metastases and therefore su-\nperior for assessing the total extent of disease [ 85–87]. PRRT is only applicable for pa-\ntients with a Karnofsky Performance Scale of at least 60 [ 27]. PRRT is contra-indicated\nfor patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding, patients with severe cardiac impairment\n(NYHA III or IV) and those with a life expectancy less than 3 months [ 31]. Since PRRT\ncan induce toxicity, the following pre-treatment laboratory values are required: creatinine\nclearance > 40 mL/min, hemoglobin levels ≥6 mmol/L, leukocytes > 2 ×109/L, platelet\ncount > 75 ×109/L, bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) and aspartate aminotrans-\nferase (ASAT) < 3 times the upper limit of normal and albumin > 3 g/dL [2,3].\n8.', 'PRRT is only applicable for pa-\ntients with a Karnofsky Performance Scale of at least 60 [ 27].

PRRT-Related Toxicity\nAdverse events related to PRRT are frequently mild and include nausea, abdominal pain\nand asthenia [ 27,50]. Increased hair loss is observed in up to 60% of patients treated with\n177Lu-DOTATATE, but this is temporary and seldom leads to baldness [ 88]. Besides these\nmild adverse events, PRRT can induce more severe toxicities which can be dose-limiting and\nadjustments to the treatment schedule might be required [ 89]. When the toxicity has subsided\nwithin 16 weeks after the last dose, guidelines advise to administer half of the original activity\nof177Lu-DOTATATE during the next cycle. PRRT should be discontinued when the toxicity\npersists after 16 weeks or recurs after the half dose [ 3]. In the NETTER-1 trial, 7% of the\npatients received a reduced dose because of dose-limiting toxicities [ 27].

Some isotopes (eg, \nlutetium 177 [177Lu]) can emit both electromag -comprehension, discovery, and design of drugs, \nserving as the basis of modern chemotherapy and \ntargeted therapies in medicine (2). More than \n100 years after being proposed, the magic bullet \nconcept remains current and influences the search \nand development of specific effective and harmless \nmolecule-driven treatments for human diseases, \nmost notably cancer. Recently, terms such as \npersonalized medicine, targeted medicine, and precision \nmedicine  have been used to represent this idea.\nAs a central component of patient care, imag-\ning has followed, and often made possible, dis-\ncoveries of drugs and treatments, evolving from a \nvaluable diagnostic tool to a now powerful guide \nfor enhancing disease characterization, patient \nselection, prediction of treatment response and \ntissue toxicity, and determination of the prog-\nnosis (3,4). In summary, imaging is integrated \ninto therapy now more than ever before. In this \ncontext, an approach referred to as theranostics \nhas been frequently used. Theranostics  is a hybrid \nterm that refers to the fusion of two words, \ntherapy and diag nostics , and this approach was \nfirst proposed in 2002 (5). Although the term is \nreportedly new, the concept behind theranostics \nis not and has been applied and revisited over the \nyears (6). Theranostics is essentially the coupling \nof diagnostic and therapeutic tools related to the \nsame specific molecular targets, enabling more \naccurate patient selection, prediction of treatment \nresponse and tissue toxicity, and response evalua-\ntion, with the goal of better outcomes.\nIn essence, theranostics refers to any combina -\ntion of diagnostic and therapeutic modalities, for \nany disease.', 'Food and Drug Administration, LET = linear energy transfer, \nmCRPC = metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, MIBG \n= metaiodobenzylguanidine, MIRD = Medical Internal Radiation \nDoses, NET = neuroendocrine tumor, PSA = prostate-specific \nantigen, PSMA = prostate-specific membrane antigen, SSR = soma-\ntostatin receptors\nSummary\nEmerging approaches to theranostics, including investigational \nradiopharmaceuticals, expanded indications for current radionuclide \ntherapies, and posttreatment imaging, are active areas of innovation \nwith potential to transform clinical practice.\nEssentials\n ■Theranostics is a concept related to radionuclide therapy that spe-\ncifically refers to the use of a pair of radiopharmaceutical agents \ncontaining radionuclides used for imaging (diagnostics) and/or \ntherapy (therapeutics).\n ■α Particles have high linear energy transfer and enable increased \nprecision in radiation delivery, which theoretically decreases col-\nlateral damage to adjacent healthy tissues and may facilitate more \nfocused targeting of small tumors and micrometastasis relative to \nthe same dose of β-particle emitters required to achieve similar \ncytotoxic effects.\n ■The imaging of theranostic agents can potentially serve multiple \nindependent purposes, including patient selection for therapy, \nconfirmation of delivery to tumors, dosimetry calculation, and \ntreatment response assessment.\n ■Both tetraazacyclododecane tetraacetic acid octreotate (or, \nDOTATATE)– and prostate-specific membrane antigen–coupled \nagents that now have regulatory approval for clinical use in neu-\nroendocrine tumors and prostate cancer, respectively, are being \ninvestigated for expanded indications in other tumor classes.\nKeywords\nMolecular Imaging, Molecular Imaging–Cancer, Molecular Imag-\ning–Clinical T ranslation, Molecular Imaging–Target Development, \nPET/CT, SPECT/CT, Radionuclide Therapy, Dosimetry, Oncol-\nogy, Radiobiology\nFigure 1: Radionuclide therapy schematic.

The vector binds to a molecular target to enable visualization of the \ntarget for diagnostic or treatment purposes and selective delivery of radiation therapy to the target. Alternatively, \na free radionuclide ion can, in some circumstances, be used to target tumors or cancer cells, as with iodine 131, \nalastine 211, and radium 223.
