This highlights the fact that there is still a need forlarge, prospective, multi-center, and controlled trials with sev-\neral years of follow-up to contribute to current findings, and\nallow for the integration of PRRT in the treatment of NETs inclinical practice guidelines. NETTER-1 trial has provided a\ngood level of evidence for the use of PRRT in GEP-NETs, and\nthis approach should be duplicated in other potential indica-tions for PRRT in NETs.\nCompliance with Ethical Standards\nConflict of Interest Nader Hirmas, Raya Jadaan, and Akram Al-\nIbraheem declare no conflict of interest.\nEthical Approval This article does not contain any studies with human\nparticipants or animals performed by any of the authors.References\n1.

The two most commonly used radio-peptides for radionuclide therapy in\nneuroendocrine tumors are90Y-DOTATOC and177Lu-DOTATATE. Radio-peptides have been used for\nseveral years in the treatment of advanced neuroendocrine tumors. Recently, the randomized Phase\nIII study NETTER-1 compared177Lu-DOTATATE versus high-dose (double-dose) octreotide LAR in\npatients with metastatic midgut neuroendocrine tumors, and demonstrated its efﬁcacy in this setting.\nStrong signals in favor of efﬁciency seem to exist for other tumors, in particular for pancreatic and\npulmonary neuroendocrine tumors. This focus on radionuclide therapy in gastroenteropancreatic and\npulmonary neuroendocrine tumors addresses the treatment modalities, the validated and potential\nindications, and the safety of the therapy.\nKeywords: neuroendocrine tumors; neoplasm metastasis; PRRT; peptide receptor radionuclide\ntherapy; gastroenteropancreatic tumor; pulmonary tumor\n1.', 'FOCUS ON MOLECULAR IMAGING\nNew Developments in Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy\nGuillaume P.

Risk factors identified in our study \nwere chemotherapy and external beam radiation, as well \nas high tumor loads defined as involvement of more than \n50% of the liver, multiple/multifocal (<10) bone and \nlymph node metatases. Development of leukemia/MDS \nafter PRRT is associated with a limited mean overall \nsurvival of 14.4 months in our study. Rates of permanent \nsevere nephrotoxicity of grade ≥4 have been described \nin as high as 9.2% in a study applying high doses of 90Y \nexclusively [24]. In contrast, severe nephrotoxicity is rare \nin patients treated by PRRT with 177Lu [28]. Incidence of \nsevere renal impairments in our study was much lower, \ndue to the mandatory renal protection followed as well as \nproper hydration of the patient after therapy.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nPatients\nBetween 2004 and 2014, 2294 patients were referred \nto Zentralklinik Bad Berka, Germany for diagnosis and \ntreatment of NENs. Of these, 570 were found to be not \neligible for PRRT and 676 patients, although eligible, did \nnot undergo the treatment for various reasons (e.g. decision \nwas reached in the interdisciplinary tumor board to \nperform first a different kind of therapy like transcatheter \narterial chemoembolisation due to high functionality of the \ntumor). The criteria used to define eligibility for PRRT \nwere in conformation with the published guidelines for \nPRRT [29] and included a Karnofsky of more than 60%, \nlife expectancy of more than 6 months, somatostatin \nreceptor positive NENs and adequate renal and bone \nmarrow function. Excluded were patients not matching \nthese criteria and somatostatin receptor negative NENs. \nThus, PRRT was performed in 1048 patients and all of \nthem were included in the intention to treat analysis \n(Figure 1). Before PRRT, patients were extensively \ninformed about the procedure and the possible side effects. \nWritten informed consent was obtained from all patients, \nwhich included permission for data storage and analysis. \nIn 2007, the responsible ethical committee permitted \nretrospective and prospective data collection and analysis \nby the German neuroendocrine tumor registry, which \nwas renewed in 2014. Data collection was performed in \naccordance with the registry. Decision to treat the patients \nby PRRT was taken by internal or external tumor boards. \nAll patients were studied by SSTR PET/CT using 68Ga-\nDOTANOC, 68Ga-DOTATOC, or 68Ga-DOTATATE \nprior to PRRT, which was also used for patient follow-\nup. All patients were either progressive before PRRT, as \ndetermined by morphological imaging (CT or MRI) or \nby SSTR PET/CT, or were severely symptomatic due to \nextensive tumor mass or functional syndromes.', '4). In vial 1, the observedline deviated from the supposed ideal de-\ncay curve at approximately 8 min. This\nwas explained by leakage of air from the\nvial through the septum, causing the vial\nto contain more ﬂuid after a certain peri-\nod. In all other vials, the dilution process\nfollowed the exponential decay curve.\nThe median estimated decay constant was\n0.2477 (range, 0.1891 –0.3224). The medi-\nan time until 50% of the radioactivitywas infused was 3.5 min (range, 3 –4\nmin), for 75% 6.5 min (range, 5 –8 min), and for 95% 15 min (range,\n10–29 min).\nDISCUSSION\nIn the current study, we have shown that it is safe to administer\nPRRT in a time span of at least 5 min (this includes ﬂushing the\nadministration system twice, thus infusing the radiopharmaceutical\nin only 1.5 min). No additional toxicity was observed, and re-\nsponse rates according to68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT scans were\ngood. The added bene ﬁt of using the gravity method for adminis-\ntering PRRT is questionable, as the laboratory experiment showedthat with the gravity method 95% of the dose is administered in 15\nmin, and 50% in 3.5 min.\nThe current study shows that a total infusion time of 5 min (in-\ncluding thorough ﬂushing of the system) with a constant infusion\nrate is safe. In terms of clinical and biochemical toxicity, no addi-\ntional occurrence of adverse events was found. The toxicity pro-ﬁles in this study are similar to previous reported studies.\nBrabander et al. published a cohort of 582 patients, in which\ngrade 3 or 4 combined hematologic toxicity (thrombocytopenia,\nleukopenia, and anemia) was observed in 10% of patients ( 18). In\nthe NETTER-1 trial, grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia occurred in 2%of patients, grade 3/4 leukopenia occurred in 1% of patients, and\ngrade 3/4 anemia was not seen after PRRT. In the current study,\noverall hematologic toxicity was quite similar (3.2% of patients,\ndue to thrombocytopenia). There was no grade 3/4 anemia or leu-\nkopenia in the current study population. However, Brabanderet al. reported grade 3/4 lymphocytopenia after PRRT in 50% of\npatients, whereas the NETTER-1 trial reported the same in 9% of\npatients. In the current study, lymphocyte counts were not ana-lyzed, as it was not measured regularly in all patients. As ob-\nserved in both mentioned studies by Brabander et al. and the\nNETTER-1 investigators, renal toxicity after PRRT is rare, most\nimportantly due to the combined infusion of an amino-acid solu-\ntion during treatment. Grade 3/4 renal toxicity is generally re-ported in 1% of treated patients, but in our cohort, no patients\nhad grade 3 or 4 renal toxicity. Therefore, and considering the\nFIGURE 1.

More\ngenerally, PRRT is an attractive therapy option for delivering\ncytotoxic radiation to tumor ce lls through speciﬁc binding of a\nradiolabeled peptide to a molecular target. The development of\nimaging companions gave rise to the concept of radiotheranostics,\nimportant for in vivo tumor detection, characterization, and staging\nbut also, and more importantly, for individual patient selection and\ntreatment. The success of somatostatin receptor targeting paved\nthe way for the clinical translation of other peptide-based radio-\npharmaceuticals targeting, for example, the receptors cholecysto-\nkinin 2, gastrin-releasing peptide, neurokinin-1, and C-X-C motif\nchemokine 4. Although historically the Auger emitter111In and the\nhigh-energy β−emitter90Y were used, most PRRT are currently\nperformed with the medium-energy β−emitter177Lu, whereas α\nemitters are increasingly studied in various clinical applications.\nKey Words: targeted radionuclide therapy; theranostics; G-protein\ncoupled receptors; beta radiation therapy; alpha radiation therapy\nJ Nucl Med 2019; 60:167–171\nDOI: 10.2967/jnumed.118.213496\nP eptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) is part of the\nwider concept of targeted radionuclide therapy. PRRT delivers\ndestructive radiation to cancer cells via radiolabeled peptides able\nto bind speciﬁcally to peptide receptors expressed in higher den-\nsity on the tumor cell membrane than in nontumor tissues. This is\nthe case for many G-protein–coupled receptors, whose overex-\npression is linked to numerous human malignancies. Regulatory\npeptides targeting G-protein–coupled receptors are a rich source\nof vectors ( 1) that can be chemically tuned to transport radioac-\ntivity while preserving their receptor afﬁnity. PRRT is used in the\ntreatment of metastatic or unresectable cancers through systemic\nor, more occasionally, locoregional administration.\nThree types of radiation are used in PRRT: b2particles (elec-\ntrons), aparticles, and Auger electrons ( 2), with a strong focus on\nb2emitters (e.g.,177Lu and90Y). Because bparticles have a long\nrange in tissues (0.05–12 mm), neighboring cells around thetargeted cell are also irradiated (cross-ﬁre effect). This effect is\nconsidered ideal for targeting large tumors with a heterogeneous\ntarget distribution. In contrast, aparticles (e.g.,213Bi and225Ac)\nhave a very short range in tissues (20–100 mm), irradiating vol-\numes with cellular dimensions and therefore sparing normal sur-\nrounding tissues from cytotoxic radiation. Their linear energy\ntransfer is much higher than the one of b2particles (50–230 vs.\n0.2 keV/ mm), making aradiation far more cytotoxic. Finally,\nAuger emitters (e.g.,111In), having a very short range in tissue\n(,20mm, subcellular dimensions) and intermediate linear energy\ntransfer (4–25 keV/ mm), may be better suited for targeting micro-\nscopic disease (i.e., micrometastases), such as in the adjuvant set-\nting.

Limited data on SSTR antagonist\nradiopeptides especially for PET applications exist, which\nmight more efficiently localise NENs due to imaging highernumber of binding sites on tumours (practically all the sub-\ntypes) and more stable binding [ 21].\nSSTRs are not only targets for radionuclide imaging but\nalso serve for radionuclide therapy of NENs. Confirmation ofreceptor affinity with diagnostic imaging can indicate the po-\ntential for peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT).PRRT using receptor agonist or antagonist, on the basis of\nthe theranostic approach has been accepted as an effective\ntreatment option for NEN, since it has been introduced.\n68Ga\nas a positron emitter radionuclide can only be used for diag-\nnostic imaging.

According to receptor\navidity and affinity, patients can be guided to PRRT. The ther-\napeutic radionuclide decision with the appropriate\nradiopeptide should be done on the basis of some factors such\nas the tumour size and location of the disease, which can easily\nbe detected by pre-therapy diagnostic PET imaging [ 22].\nAlong with SSTR, NENs can be imaged by using other\nmolecular and metabolic targets due to their neuroendocrinefunctional features.

It has shown efficacy in treating metastatic cancer, particularly in grades 1 and 2 NETs, with improved quality of life and survival rates.

Conclusions\nPRRT has anti-tumor efﬁcacy in NETs with a beneﬁt in terms of objective response rate\nand survival without progression. The level of evidence varies depending on the location\nof the primary lesion. The NETTER-1 trial, a randomized Phase III study, validated the\nplace of PRRT early in midgut NETs.

In the NETTER-1 study, all patients remained\non long-acting release octreotide despite prior progression on this\ndrug, and the177Lu-DOTATATE package insert suggests that patients\nshould remain on SSAs for up to 18 mo after treatment ( 6). How-\never, there are no clear data to support or refute this recommendation.\nTREATMENT LOCATION\nSites have the option to provide PRRT in an inpatient or out-\npatient setting, within the oncology infusion clinic or nuclear med-\nicine department, or a combination of both locations. Most sites in\nthe United States treat in the outpatient setting. Oncology nursing\nstaff are often more accustomed to the complexities of required\nconcomitant medication infusions and patient monitoring than\nnuclear medicine staff, but nuclear medicine staff are well\ntrained in radiation safety and the necessary precautions required\nduring administration of radioa ctivity. If a combination approach\nis taken (i.e., the patient is transported between departments for\nspeciﬁc components of the proced ure), extra caution regarding\nradiation protection is require d for patient travel. When treated\nas an outpatient, a patient should be forewarned of the uncommon\npossibility of an overnight hospital stay should a complication such\nas a neuroendocrine hormonal crisis or severe emesis occur ( 6).\nROOM PREPARATION\nBecause body ﬂuids (primarily urine) are radioactive after177Lu-\nDOTATATE administration, room preparation is essential to reduce\npotential contamination.

More\ngenerally, PRRT is an attractive therapy option for delivering\ncytotoxic radiation to tumor ce lls through speciﬁc binding of a\nradiolabeled peptide to a molecular target. The development of\nimaging companions gave rise to the concept of radiotheranostics,\nimportant for in vivo tumor detection, characterization, and staging\nbut also, and more importantly, for individual patient selection and\ntreatment. The success of somatostatin receptor targeting paved\nthe way for the clinical translation of other peptide-based radio-\npharmaceuticals targeting, for example, the receptors cholecysto-\nkinin 2, gastrin-releasing peptide, neurokinin-1, and C-X-C motif\nchemokine 4. Although historically the Auger emitter111In and the\nhigh-energy β−emitter90Y were used, most PRRT are currently\nperformed with the medium-energy β−emitter177Lu, whereas α\nemitters are increasingly studied in various clinical applications.\nKey Words: targeted radionuclide therapy; theranostics; G-protein\ncoupled receptors; beta radiation therapy; alpha radiation therapy\nJ Nucl Med 2019; 60:167–171\nDOI: 10.2967/jnumed.118.213496\nP eptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) is part of the\nwider concept of targeted radionuclide therapy. PRRT delivers\ndestructive radiation to cancer cells via radiolabeled peptides able\nto bind speciﬁcally to peptide receptors expressed in higher den-\nsity on the tumor cell membrane than in nontumor tissues. This is\nthe case for many G-protein–coupled receptors, whose overex-\npression is linked to numerous human malignancies. Regulatory\npeptides targeting G-protein–coupled receptors are a rich source\nof vectors ( 1) that can be chemically tuned to transport radioac-\ntivity while preserving their receptor afﬁnity. PRRT is used in the\ntreatment of metastatic or unresectable cancers through systemic\nor, more occasionally, locoregional administration.\nThree types of radiation are used in PRRT: b2particles (elec-\ntrons), aparticles, and Auger electrons ( 2), with a strong focus on\nb2emitters (e.g.,177Lu and90Y). Because bparticles have a long\nrange in tissues (0.05–12 mm), neighboring cells around thetargeted cell are also irradiated (cross-ﬁre effect). This effect is\nconsidered ideal for targeting large tumors with a heterogeneous\ntarget distribution. In contrast, aparticles (e.g.,213Bi and225Ac)\nhave a very short range in tissues (20–100 mm), irradiating vol-\numes with cellular dimensions and therefore sparing normal sur-\nrounding tissues from cytotoxic radiation. Their linear energy\ntransfer is much higher than the one of b2particles (50–230 vs.\n0.2 keV/ mm), making aradiation far more cytotoxic. Finally,\nAuger emitters (e.g.,111In), having a very short range in tissue\n(,20mm, subcellular dimensions) and intermediate linear energy\ntransfer (4–25 keV/ mm), may be better suited for targeting micro-\nscopic disease (i.e., micrometastases), such as in the adjuvant set-\nting. All above-mentioned radionuclides are radiometals ( Table 1).']",4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,1.0,1.0,1.0,46

The decision to provide PRRNTshould be taken within a multidisciplinary tumour board,\nincluding all the specialists involved in the care of patients\nwith NET. The facility requirements will depend on nationallegislation on the therapeutic use of radioactive agents. If\ninpatient therapy is required by national legislation, the\ntreatment should take place in an approved facility. Thefacility must have appropriate personnel, radiation safety\nequipment, and procedures for waste management and han-\ndling accidental contamination of the site or personnel.\n90Y-DOTATOC or177Lu-DOTATATE should be admin-\nistered by appropriately trained medical staff with support-\ning nursing staff with a medical physics expert available.\nPhysicians responsible for treating patients should have a\ngeneral knowledge of the pathophysiology and natural historyof the respective diseases, should be familiar with alternative\nforms of therapy, and should be able to closely liaise with\nother physicians involved in managing the patients.

Nephrotoxicity may be aggravated by risk factors,such as preexisting hypertension or diabetes mellitus [ 57]. To\ncounteract and reduce the high kidney retention of radiopep-\ntides, positively charged amino acids, such as\nL-lysine and/or\nL-arginine, are coinfused to competitively inhibit the proximal\ntubular reabsorption of the radiopeptide. The coadministration\nof these amino acids leads to a significant reduction in the\nrenal absorbed dose, which ranges from 9 % to 53 % [ 58].\nRenal absorbed dose is further reduced by up to 39 % byextending the infusion time of the amino acid solution over\n10 h, and up to 65 % by extending the protection over 2 days\nfollowing radiopeptide administration, thereby covering therenal elimination phase more efficiently [ 59,60].\nAmino acid protection protocols\nLysine and/or arginine should be diluted appropriately in\nlarge volumes of normal saline in order to hydrate thepatient, unless the patient suffers from cardiac insufficiency\n(e.g. carcinoid heart valve disease), in which case volume\noverload, possibly leading to acute exacerbation of the con-dition, should be avoided.

One study showed that\nsalvage therapy with two additional cycles of\n177Lu-octreotate\ndoes not lead to serious hematologic or nephrotoxic side ef-\nfects, but the tumor response rate was less compared with\ninitial treatment [ 50].\nAnother report showed that long PFS after the initial treat-\nment with PRRT predicts a prolonged PFS after salvage ther-apy [ 51], and argued that PRRT with\n177Lu-octreotate in the\nretreatment setting is a safe and effective option in patients\nwith metastatic GEP-NETs. For these reasons, retreatment\nseems a good option for patients who responded well after\nthe initial cycles of PRRT [ 52]. This novel and important\nconcept of salvage therapy of NET needs to be tested in large,\nprospective, and multi-center trials to contribute to evidence-\nbased findings.\nTreatment Side Effects\nPRRT is generally well-tolerated. Side effects can be divided to\nacute, subacute, and long-term side effects, as summarized inTable 4. Acute side effects are usually mild and self-limiting.\nNausea or vomiting are related to the concomitant admin-\nistration of kidney-protective amino acids. Subacute side\neffects are related to the radiopeptide itself, such as bonemarrow suppression, mild hair loss (observed with\n177Lu-\noctreotate), or, more rarely, an exacerbation of a clinicalsyndrome. The most common subacute side effect ofPRRT, occurring within 4 to 6 weeks after therapy, is bone\nmarrow suppression. Usually, the hematologic toxicity is\nmild and reversible. More serious WHO grade 3 or 4 tox-icity may occur, but this has been seen in less than 15% of\npatients [ 53].\nLong-term side effects of PRRT may include renal failure\nas well as leukemia/myelody splastic syndromes (MDS).\nBecause radiopeptides are usually reabsorbed in the proximal\ntubules, they can accumulate in the renal interstitium and in-duce inflammation and fibrosis with eventual kidney damage.\nCo-administration of positively charged amino acids results ina reduction of renal radioactive uptake, up to 40% as reportedin some studies [ 16,54]. If patients have long-standing or\npoorly controlled comorbidities such as diabetes and hyper-\ntension that affect kidney function, it is expected that there\nwould be a larger and more persistent decline in creatinine\nclearance [ 55].\nAdministration of Treatment\nFor purposes of kidney protection, positively charged amino\nacids, such as L-lysine and/or L-arginine, are co-infused to\ncompetitively inhibit the proximal tubular reabsorption ofthe radiopeptide [ 56]. This reduces the renal-absorbed dose.\nDilution of the amino acids with saline allows proper hydra-tion for the patient, an appropriate ratio to use is 25 g of aminoacid in 1 L of normal saline. Obviously, patients ’comorbidi-\nties should be taken into account (e.g., avoid volume overloadin patients with cardiac insufficiency and take care in avoidingelectrolyte imbalances with hyperosmotic solutions).\nAntiemetics can be administered before the infusion to avoidpotential nausea or vomiting. Amino acid infusion should bestarted 30 –60 min before administration of the radiopeptide\nand should be maintained over 4 h. Several amino acid pro-tective schemes have been proposed in the joint IAEA,EANM, and SNMMI practical guidelines on PRRT treatment\nof NETs [ 56].\nCurrent administration schedules comprise the most ap-\npropriate number of cycles (generally four or five) and thebest delivery frequency (8 weeks apart).

Rates of permanent \nsevere nephrotoxicity of grade ≥4 have been described \nin as high as 9.2% in a study applying high doses of 90Y \nexclusively [24]. In contrast, severe nephrotoxicity is rare \nin patients treated by PRRT with 177Lu [28]. Incidence of \nsevere renal impairments in our study was much lower, \ndue to the mandatory renal protection followed as well as \nproper hydration of the patient after therapy.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nPatients\nBetween 2004 and 2014, 2294 patients were referred \nto Zentralklinik Bad Berka, Germany for diagnosis and \ntreatment of NENs. Of these, 570 were found to be not \neligible for PRRT and 676 patients, although eligible, did \nnot undergo the treatment for various reasons (e.g. decision \nwas reached in the interdisciplinary tumor board to \nperform first a different kind of therapy like transcatheter \narterial chemoembolisation due to high functionality of the \ntumor). The criteria used to define eligibility for PRRT \nwere in conformation with the published guidelines for \nPRRT [29] and included a Karnofsky of more than 60%, \nlife expectancy of more than 6 months, somatostatin \nreceptor positive NENs and adequate renal and bone \nmarrow function. Excluded were patients not matching \nthese criteria and somatostatin receptor negative NENs. \nThus, PRRT was performed in 1048 patients and all of \nthem were included in the intention to treat analysis \n(Figure 1). Before PRRT, patients were extensively \ninformed about the procedure and the possible side effects. \nWritten informed consent was obtained from all patients, \nwhich included permission for data storage and analysis. \nIn 2007, the responsible ethical committee permitted \nretrospective and prospective data collection and analysis \nby the German neuroendocrine tumor registry, which \nwas renewed in 2014. Data collection was performed in \naccordance with the registry. Decision to treat the patients \nby PRRT was taken by internal or external tumor boards. \nAll patients were studied by SSTR PET/CT using 68Ga-\nDOTANOC, 68Ga-DOTATOC, or 68Ga-DOTATATE \nprior to PRRT, which was also used for patient follow-\nup. All patients were either progressive before PRRT, as \ndetermined by morphological imaging (CT or MRI) or \nby SSTR PET/CT, or were severely symptomatic due to \nextensive tumor mass or functional syndromes.']",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1.0,0.0,0.5,31

They are usually given only \nonce, or sometimes on a few occasions, and contain only small amounts of the active substances with a \nradionuclide attached to them to allow scintigra phic imaging, measurement of biodistribution or \ntherapeutic treatment. Such radiopharmaceuticals do often not show any measurable pharmacodynamic \neffect.  Radiation is a general property of all radi opharmaceuticals, which when administered gives the \npatient an inevitable radiation dose. In the case of therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals, the radiation effect \nis the wanted property. \nRadiopharmaceuticals have decreasing content of radioactivity with time, as a consequence of the \nradioactive decay.  The physical half-life of the radionuclide is often shor t for radiopharmaceutical \ndiagnostics. In these cases, the final preparation has to be done shortly before administration to the patient. This is in particular the case for positron emitting radiopharmaceuticals for Tomography (PET \nradiopharmaceuticals). It often leads to the use of  semi-manufactured products such as radionuclide \ngenerators, radioactive precursors and kits.  \n2. SCOPE \nThis guideline covers the following products: \n- ready-for-use radiopharmaceuticals, including PET radiopharmaceuticals;  \n- non-radioactive components (kits and chemical precursors including those for positron \nemission Tomography) for combination with a radioactive component (e.g. eluate from a \nradionuclide generator or a cyclotron produced radionuclide);  \n- radionuclide generators; \n- radionuclide precursors used for radiolabelling other substances prior to administration.  \nArticle 3.5 of Directive 2001/83/EC specifically mentions radionuclides in sealed sources as being \noutside the requirements of the Directive, and therefore outside the scope of this guideline. \nConcerning radiopharmaceuticals based monoclonal antibodies, a separate guideline exists (3AQ21a). \nConcerning radiopharmaceuticals intended in the conduct of clinical trials (investigational medicinal \nproducts), the principles of this guideline expressed  in eudralex vol 10 have to be applied.  \nEMEA/CHMP/QWP/306970/2007   Page 3/10', '177____________________________________________________________ 3AQ20a   n\nRADIOPHARMACEUTICALS\n1 . INTRODUCTION\nApplications for marketing authorisation in respect of radiopharmaceuticals should be\naccompanied, as in the case of all medicinal products, by the particulars and documents\nreferred to in Directives 65/65/EEC and 75/319/EEC, as amended, and in the Annex of\nDirective 75/318/EEC as amended. The provisions of Directive 89/343/EEC also ap ply. The\nrelevant provisions of the European Pharmacopoeia should be observed. Due account must betaken of the other relevant CPMP guidelines.\nMost radiopharmaceuticals are used for the purpose of medical diagnosis. They are usually\ngiven only once, or sometimes on a few o ccasions, and contain only small amounts of the\nactive substances with a radionuclide attached to them to allow scintigraphic imaging or\nmeasurement of biodistribution. Such radiopharmaceuticals do not often show any\nmeasurable pharmacodynamic effect. Radiation is a general property of all\nradiopharmaceuticals, which when administered give the patient an inevitable radiation\ndose. In the case of therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals, the radiation effect is the wanted\nproperty. Evaluation of the safety and efficacy of radiopharmaceuticals should include\nradiopharmaceutical and radiation hygiene aspects and radiation dosimetry in addition to\ngeneral parameters.\nRadiopharmaceuticals have changing composition with time, associated with the radioactive\ndecay. The physical half-life of the radionuclide is often so short that, in these cases, the\nfinal preparation has to be done immediately before administration to the patient; this leads\nto the use of semi-manufactured products such as radionuclide generators, precursors and\nkits. Evaluation of the safety and efficacy of radiopharmaceuticals is also concerned with\nthe specifications of generators, kits and other semi-manufactured products. Specifications\nmay also require special attention in cases where samples from the patient are labelled with\na radioactive substance before readministration (precursor radiopharmaceuticals). When\nradiopharmaceuticals go directly from the generator to the patient (e.g. ultra short-lived\nradioactive gases), the consistency of the production process has a particularly great\nimportance.\nThis note for guidance covers the following products:\n– ready-for-use radiopharmaceuticals;\n– non-radioactive components (kits) for combination with a radioactive component\n(usually the eluate from a radionuclide generator);\n– radionuclide generators;– precursors used for radiolabelling other substances prior to administration\n(e.g. samples from patients).']",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0,1.0,1.0,1.0,9

Current Status of PSMA-Targeting Agents\nTo date, varieties of urea-based PSMA-targeting agents have been reported for imag-\ning, radiotherapy, or theranostic applications when labeled with imaging and therapeutic\nradionuclides. Some of them have moved to clinical trials. For theranostic applications,\nthe current practice is through a sequential administration of diagnostic and therapeutic\nradiopharmaceuticals, where the diagnostic one provides guidance to oncologists before\nthe treatment. In such a sequential practice, the chemical differences between the diag-\nnostic and therapeutic pair, which likely give rise to different in vivo kinetic proﬁles, may\ncompromise the purpose of theranostic strategies for precision treatment [ 62]. On the other\nhand, we have started seeing efforts to tackle the problem by developing a concurrent\ntheranostic strategy, where an identical theranostic pair of agents employed for simultane-\nous diagnosis and therapy without altering the in vivo distribution and kinetics [ 63]. For\nthe development of more efﬁcacious PSMA-targeting agents (measured by higher speciﬁc\nPSMA binding and more favorable in vivo kinetics), many structural determinants need to\nbe considered in the chemical modiﬁcation or novel design, such as charge, length, chemical\ncomponents, hydrophilicity vs. lipophilicity, etc. In the meantime, the accessibility of the\nwhole conjugate should not be obstructed to the active site through the funnel (~20Å) in\nPSMA (Figure 1) [64].\n2.1.

The ability of somatostatin analogs to control the growth ofwell-differentiated metastatic NETs is a matter of debate. We performed a placebo-controlled,double-blind, phase IIIB study in patients with well-differentiated metastatic midgut NETs. Thehypothesis was that octreotide LAR prolongs time to tumor progression and survival.\nPatients and Methods\nTreatment-naive patients were randomly assigned to either placebo or octreotide LAR 30 mg\nintramuscularly in monthly intervals until tumor progression or death. The primary efﬁcacy endpoint was time to tumor progression. Secondary end points were survival time and tumorresponse. This report is based on 67 tumor progressions and 16 observed deaths in 85 patientsat the time of the planned interim analysis.\nResults\nMedian time to tumor progression in the octreotide LAR and placebo groups was 14.3 and 6\nmonths, respectively (hazard ratio [HR] /H110050.34; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.59; P/H11005.000072). After 6 months\nof treatment, stable disease was observed in 66.7% of patients in the octreotide LAR group and37.2% of patients in the placebo group. Functionally active and inactive tumors respondedsimilarly. The most favorable effect was observed in patients with low hepatic tumor load andresected primary tumor. Seven and nine deaths were observed in the octreotide LAR and placebogroups, respectively. The HR for overall survival was 0.81 (95% CI, 0.30 to 2.18).', 'The main endpoint of the study was to look at PFS in thesetwo groups. Although overall survival is a desirable end-\npoint in many cancers, this has proven to be very\nchallenging in NET studies. Patients often live for a longtime, and therefore may receive many different therapies\nand follow-up must be long. Cross-over from one therapy\nto another is common, such as from PRRT to TT/CT or thereverse. Another confounder is that these studies are ret-\nrospective, leading to bias as to which therapy is given ﬁrst,\nas well as other factors, such as whether patients are\nreferred for primary tumor resection and/or cytoreduction\nof metastases.

During the past \ndecades, there has been a simultaneous unex -\nplained rising incidence of neuroendocrine tumors, \nespecially gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine \nneoplasms, which have increased from 10.9 to 52.4 \ncases per million tumors in the United States (23).Somatostatin is an oligopeptide hormone nor -\nmally encountered in the hypothalamus, nervous \nsystem, pancreas, and gastrointestinal tract (24). \nSSTRs have been found on various cells of neuro -\nendocrine origin, including tumors, and somatosta -\ntin inhibits tumor cell growth. The understanding \nthat certain types of neoplasms may overexpress \nSSTR dates back to the 1980s (25), and this insight \nlater offered the opportunity to use radiolabeled \nsomatostatin analog radioligands for theranostics.\nThe evolution toward a theranostic approach to \ndiagnose and treat neuroendocrine tumors took a \nstep forward in 1993, when the Rotterdam experi -\nence was published (24), with more than 1000 \npatients imaged with 111In–diethylenetriamine -\npentaacetic acid octreotide (111In-pentetreotide \n[OctreoScan, Curium; London, England, and \nParis, France]), a radiolabeled peptide for neuro -\nendocrine tumor evaluation, staging, and char -\nacterization with scintigraphy. Later, in 1994, the \nU.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the \nuse of OctreoScan as an imaging radiopharmaceu -\ntical owing to its higher sensitivity and specificity \nfor gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumor \nevaluation compared with the sensitivity and \nspecificity of conventional imaging.\nFollowing use of the radioiodine prototype for \nthyroid cancer, the first peptide receptor radio-\nnuclide therapy (PRRT) procedures emerged in \n1992, with very high doses of 111In-pentetreotide \nused to explore a particular type of radioactive \nFigure 8.

24E naive RAG,"Is it possible to compare the different guidelines for the management of neuroendocrine tumors (ENETS, NANETS)? Where are the differences in the therapy of this disease?",english,specific,guidelines,command-r-plus naive RAG,"Yes, it is possible to compare the different guidelines for the management of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) between the European Neuroendocrine Tumor Society (ENETS) and the North American Neuroendocrine Tumor Society (NANETS). While both organizations provide guidelines for the management of NETs, they may differ in their specific recommendations and areas of focus due to varying expert opinions and regional considerations. 

Some key differences between ENETS and NANETS guidelines include: 

- ENETS guidelines tend to be more comprehensive and detailed, covering various aspects of NET management, including specific recommendations for different types of NETs (such as gastroenteropancreatic and bronchial NETs) and even providing guidelines for managing metastases to specific organs, like the peritoneum, bone, and lung. 

- NANETS guidelines, on the other hand, often focus on more generalized surveillance and medical management strategies for NETs, particularly for midgut neuroendocrine tumors. 

- ENETS guidelines are primarily European-focused, while NANETS guidelines are geared towards a North American context, taking into account regional differences in healthcare systems, available treatments, and patient populations. 

- The timing of updates and the incorporation of new research findings may differ between the two organizations, leading to variations in their recommendations over time. 

It is important for clinicians to be aware of these differences and to refer to the most up-to-date guidelines from both organizations when managing patients with NETs, adapting their approach based on individual patient needs and the specific context of their healthcare setting.

Development of leukemia/MDS \nafter PRRT is associated with a limited mean overall \nsurvival of 14.4 months in our study. Rates of permanent \nsevere nephrotoxicity of grade ≥4 have been described \nin as high as 9.2% in a study applying high doses of 90Y \nexclusively [24]. In contrast, severe nephrotoxicity is rare \nin patients treated by PRRT with 177Lu [28]. Incidence of \nsevere renal impairments in our study was much lower, \ndue to the mandatory renal protection followed as well as \nproper hydration of the patient after therapy.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nPatients\nBetween 2004 and 2014, 2294 patients were referred \nto Zentralklinik Bad Berka, Germany for diagnosis and \ntreatment of NENs. Of these, 570 were found to be not \neligible for PRRT and 676 patients, although eligible, did \nnot undergo the treatment for various reasons (e.g. decision \nwas reached in the interdisciplinary tumor board to \nperform first a different kind of therapy like transcatheter \narterial chemoembolisation due to high functionality of the \ntumor). The criteria used to define eligibility for PRRT \nwere in conformation with the published guidelines for \nPRRT [29] and included a Karnofsky of more than 60%, \nlife expectancy of more than 6 months, somatostatin \nreceptor positive NENs and adequate renal and bone \nmarrow function. Excluded were patients not matching \nthese criteria and somatostatin receptor negative NENs. \nThus, PRRT was performed in 1048 patients and all of \nthem were included in the intention to treat analysis \n(Figure 1). Before PRRT, patients were extensively \ninformed about the procedure and the possible side effects. \nWritten informed consent was obtained from all patients, \nwhich included permission for data storage and analysis. \nIn 2007, the responsible ethical committee permitted \nretrospective and prospective data collection and analysis \nby the German neuroendocrine tumor registry, which \nwas renewed in 2014. Data collection was performed in \naccordance with the registry. Decision to treat the patients \nby PRRT was taken by internal or external tumor boards. \nAll patients were studied by SSTR PET/CT using 68Ga-\nDOTANOC, 68Ga-DOTATOC, or 68Ga-DOTATATE \nprior to PRRT, which was also used for patient follow-\nup. All patients were either progressive before PRRT, as \ndetermined by morphological imaging (CT or MRI) or \nby SSTR PET/CT, or were severely symptomatic due to \nextensive tumor mass or functional syndromes.']",2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1.0,0.0,0.5,8

Future Use of Alfa-Emmitters Binded to Somatostatin Antagonists\nThe use of alpha emitting radionuclides in PRRT could potentially increase the level\nof tumoral cell death by increasing the number of DNA double-strand breaks. Alpha\nradiations can easily be shielded, however, they transmit lots of energy with a great\npenetrating power, and in this way they could be used for treatment. These radionuclides\ninclude 212Lead-212 (212Pb), 213Bismuth (213Bi) and 225Actinium (225Ac). Promising\nresults with 213Bi have been published in which enduring responses were observed in all\ntreated patients with moderate kidney toxicity and with even less acute hematotoxicity\nthan with the preceding beta therapies. Recently, a phase 1 study has been completed\nand results are pending. [212Pb]Pb-DOTAM-TATE has been tested. The primary objective\nwas to assess the dose limiting toxicity using ascending doses of this radionuclide. The\nsecondary objectives were to determine preliminary efﬁcacy as well as the pharmacokinetic\nproperties [83–85].\n7. Future of the Use of Somatostatin Receptors as Targets on Neuroendocrine T umors:\nSomatostatin Antagonists\nAn important development in the ﬁeld of SSTR targeting is the recent introduction\nof SSTR antagonists. SSTR antagonists seem to recognize more binding sites on receptors\nand show better tumor visualization than agonists and more favorable pharmacokinetics\ndespite a poor internalization rate [86,87].\nSeveral SSTR antagonists have been studied since 1996, in which Bass was developed\nﬁrst [ 88]. Of all the somatostatin antagonists developed so far, the analogue JR11 performed\nthe best in preclinical settings.

Two groups of NEN behave \nbiologically and clinically distinctively different; the well \ndifferentiated slowly growing neuroendocrine tumors with \nan excellent to good prognosis and poorly differentiated \nfast growing neuroendocrine carcinomas with a poor \nprognosis. Grading of NENs is performed by Ki67 index. \nG1 and G2 neuroendocrine tumors have a Ki67 index \nof 20% or below whereas neuroendocrine carcinomas \nhave a Ki 67 index of more than 20%. Neuroendocrine \ncarcinomas are defined by small or large cell morphology. \nIn addition, the new WHO classification of pancreatic \nNENs includes the newly created well differentiated \nneuroendocrine tumors with a proliferation of up to \n50% as neuroendocrine tumor G3 [2, 3]. NENs may be \nfunctionally active due to the autonomous secretion of \nbiogenic amines or peptide hormones such as serotonin, \ngastrin or insulin causing characteristic functional \nsyndromes [4].\nThe majority of well-differentiated NENs \noverexpress receptors of the 5 subclasses of somatostatin \nreceptors (SSTRs), most frequently receptors 2 and 5. \nActivated SSTRs have anti-secretory and anti-proliferative \nactivity, and are targeted by stable somatostatin analogues \nfor treatment of functional syndromes and to reduce tumor \ngrowth of NENs [5–7]. In addition, SSTR are utilized to \nvisualize NENs by molecular imaging. SSTR scintigraphy \nuses stable somatostatin analogues coupled to short-\nlived radionuclides such as 111Indium or 99mTechnetium. \nThe more recently developed SSTR PET/CT involves \n68Gallium (68Ga) as a positron emitter, coupled to stable \nsomatostatin analogues. This technique is more sensitive, \nfaster with much lesser radiation exposure, compared to \nthe standard SSTR scintigraphy [8]. Netspot, the first \nkit for the preparation of 68Ga-DOTATATE for PET/\nCT imaging of NENs was recently approved by the US \nFDA ( http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/InformationOnDrugs/\nucm508921.htm ).\nCoupling beta- and/or gamma-emitting \nradionuclides to stable somatostatin analogues permits \ninternal radiation of SSTR-expressing NENs by peptide \nreceptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT). 90Yttrium (90Y) and \n177Lutetium (177Lu) are used as radionuclides and chelated \nto stable somatostatin analogues such as DOTATATE \nand DOTATOC [9, 10]. Numerous phase I and phase II \nstudies have shown favorable progression-free survival \n(PFS) and overall survival (OS) in NEN patients compared \nto historical controls [9–11]. Recently, a phase III study \n(NETTER-1 trial) has compared 4 cycles of PRRT, each \nusing 7.4 GBq of 177Lu-DOTATATE (Lutathera®) together \nwith 30 mg Octreotide-LAR every 4 weeks, to high dose somatostatin analogue therapy with 2 x 30 mg Octreotide-\nLAR every 4 weeks. Patients with progressive NENs of \nsmall bowel under treatment with somatostatin analogues \nand with SSTR expression were included, and 230 were \nrandomized in a 1:1 ratio. In the control group, median \nPFS was 8.4 months, whereas it was not reached yet in the \nLutathera® group (estimation 40 months). The hazard ratio \nwas 0.209 (95% CI, 0.129-0.33) in favor of Lutathera®. \nAdverse events were rare and the treatment was well \ntolerated [12].', 'Conclusions\n•We will develop a bioinformatics \npipeline that will integrate \ngenetic data with structural and \nfunctional imaging, \nhistopathology and phenotype \ninformation for implementation \ninto clinical practice\n•Data from this study are \nexpected to contribute to \nindividualised management   \nof GEP -NET patients\nCorrespondence to:\nMedical.affairs@itm -radiopharma.com\nClinical Phase III Trial COMPOSE \nClinicalTrials.gov NCT04919226\nIndustry -sponsored studyJ.

27E naive RAG,What was the median PFS in the Netter-2 trial?,english,specific,study,command-r-plus naive RAG,The provided context does not contain any information about the median PFS in the Netter-2 trial.,"['7,10The ongoing COMPETE trial is currently looking\nat this very question in GEPNETs, with one group beingrandomized to\n177Lu-edotreotide PRRT and the other to\neverolimus.16For patients with pancreatic NETs, there are\nmore choices available, which include PRRT, sunitinib,everolimus, and capecitabine/temozolomide, which may\nhelp explain why over three quarters of patients initially\nreceived TT/CT instead of PRRT in this study. Greateruncertainty remains in patients with higher-grade tumors,\nwho did not appear to derive as much beneﬁt from PRRT.\nThe ongoing NETTER-2 trial (NCT03972488), which israndomizing patients with higher-grade GEPNETs (well-\ndifferentiated, grade 2 and 3 with Ki-67 10–55%) to PRRT\n(with 30 mg Sandostatin LAR, q 4 weeks) vs high-doseSSAs, will help determine the efﬁcacy of PRRT in these\npatients. If a PFS beneﬁt is found in NETTER-2, the\nquestion of whether this is superior to TT or CT willremain, especially for patients with PNETs. That question\nmay be answered by the COMPOSE trial, comparing\n177Lu-edotreotide PRRT to best standard of care (including\nall TT and CT) in aggressive grade 2 and grade 3 GEP-\nNETs.16Another relevant trial just opening is Alliance for\nClinical Trials in Oncology A022001 (ComPareNET;NCT05247905), which will randomize patients with pro-\ngressive, advanced, well-differentiated grade 1–3\npancreatic NETs to PRRT (\n177Lu-DOTATATE x 4 cycles)\nor 12 cycles of capecitabine/temozolomide.\nPusceddu et al. have given us valuable understanding of\ntreatment patterns of patients with progressive pancreatic\nand intestinal NETs in Italy, and how PRRT may improve\nPFS in many patients. However, it also suffers from thesame issues dogging all non-randomized studies in NETs.\nFirst is the concern with selection bias, which these authors\naddressed by propensity-matching. Second is the fact thatpatients usually live long enough to cross over to the other\ntherapeutic arm. Since overall survival was not affected in\nthis study, how can we be sure that giving PRRT before orafter TT/CT is better for patients? We do know that PRRT\nwith\n177Lu-DOTATATE is fairly safe, with low incidence\nof nephrotoxicity, a 2% rate of myelodysplastic syndromeor leukemia, and only 6% of patients having grade 3 or 4\nadverse events.\n8Grade 3 or 4 adverse events leading to\ntreatment discontinuation occurred in 12% of patientsreceiving everolimus in RADIANT-4,\n10and even more\ngrade 3 or 4 adverse events were seen in pancreatic NET\npatients treated with sunitinib.11Time to deterioration of\nquality of life may be another important measure to be\nconsidered when choosing the next therapy on progression.\nThis duration was signiﬁcantly longer in the177Lu-\nDOTATATE group in NETTER-1.15Although the results\nof the current study would seem to favor PRRT as the next6502 J.

INTRODUCTION\nApplications for marketing authorisation in respect of radiopharmaceuticals should be\naccompanied, as in the case of all medicinal products, by the particulars and documents\nreferred to in Directives 65/65/EEC and 75/319/EEC, as amended, and in the Annex of\nDirective 75/318/EEC as amended. The provisions of Directive 89/343/EEC also ap ply. The\nrelevant provisions of the European Pharmacopoeia should be observed. Due account must betaken of the other relevant CPMP guidelines.\nMost radiopharmaceuticals are used for the purpose of medical diagnosis. They are usually\ngiven only once, or sometimes on a few o ccasions, and contain only small amounts of the\nactive substances with a radionuclide attached to them to allow scintigraphic imaging or\nmeasurement of biodistribution. Such radiopharmaceuticals do not often show any\nmeasurable pharmacodynamic effect. Radiation is a general property of all\nradiopharmaceuticals, which when administered give the patient an inevitable radiation\ndose. In the case of therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals, the radiation effect is the wanted\nproperty. Evaluation of the safety and efficacy of radiopharmaceuticals should include\nradiopharmaceutical and radiation hygiene aspects and radiation dosimetry in addition to\ngeneral parameters.\nRadiopharmaceuticals have changing composition with time, associated with the radioactive\ndecay. The physical half-life of the radionuclide is often so short that, in these cases, the\nfinal preparation has to be done immediately before administration to the patient; this leads\nto the use of semi-manufactured products such as radionuclide generators, precursors and\nkits. Evaluation of the safety and efficacy of radiopharmaceuticals is also concerned with\nthe specifications of generators, kits and other semi-manufactured products. Specifications\nmay also require special attention in cases where samples from the patient are labelled with\na radioactive substance before readministration (precursor radiopharmaceuticals). When\nradiopharmaceuticals go directly from the generator to the patient (e.g. ultra short-lived\nradioactive gases), the consistency of the production process has a particularly great\nimportance.\nThis note for guidance covers the following products:\n– ready-for-use radiopharmaceuticals;\n– non-radioactive components (kits) for combination with a radioactive component\n(usually the eluate from a radionuclide generator);\n– radionuclide generators;– precursors used for radiolabelling other substances prior to administration\n(e.g. samples from patients).']",2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1.0,0.0,0.5,11

The aim of this guideline on \nmolar activity is to provide a review of basic concepts, practical considerations, pitfalls \nand recommendations for obtaining high molar activity  (Am) or specific activity  (As).\nIn the field of radiopharmaceutical sciences, small molecules, peptides and macro -\nmolecules radiolabelled for diagnostic and therapeutic applications are defined as radi -\nolabelled compounds where a radionuclide is attached by covalent or ionic bonds to a \nnon-radioactive molecular scaffold (precursor). A radiotracer is a radiolabelled com -\npound that is often administered to a complex environment (e.g. a tissue or living organ -\nism) without perturbing the system under study.\nMost radionuclides used for the production of radiotracers are obtained via ‘no-car -\nrier’ added (n.c.a.) nuclear reactions (definitions for carrier and n.c.a. can be found in Abstract \nThis guideline on molar activity  (Am) and specific activity  (As) focusses on small mol-\necules, peptides and macromolecules radiolabelled for diagnostic and therapeutic \napplications. In this guideline we describe the definition of  Am and  As, and how these \nmeasurements must be standardised and harmonised. Selected examples highlighting \nthe importance of  Am and  As in imaging studies of saturable binding sites will be given, \nand the necessity of using appropriate materials and equipment will be discussed. \nFurthermore, common  Am pitfalls and remedies are described. Finally, some aspects of \n Am in relation the emergence of a new generation of highly sensitive PET scanners will \nbe discussed.\nKeywords: Molar activity  (Am), Specific activity  (As), Tracers, Standardisation, Carrier, \nMass, Radioactivity, RadiochemistryOpen Access\n© The Author(s), 2021.

INTRODUCTION\nApplications for marketing authorisation in respect of radiopharmaceuticals should be\naccompanied, as in the case of all medicinal products, by the particulars and documents\nreferred to in Directives 65/65/EEC and 75/319/EEC, as amended, and in the Annex of\nDirective 75/318/EEC as amended. The provisions of Directive 89/343/EEC also ap ply. The\nrelevant provisions of the European Pharmacopoeia should be observed. Due account must betaken of the other relevant CPMP guidelines.\nMost radiopharmaceuticals are used for the purpose of medical diagnosis. They are usually\ngiven only once, or sometimes on a few o ccasions, and contain only small amounts of the\nactive substances with a radionuclide attached to them to allow scintigraphic imaging or\nmeasurement of biodistribution. Such radiopharmaceuticals do not often show any\nmeasurable pharmacodynamic effect. Radiation is a general property of all\nradiopharmaceuticals, which when administered give the patient an inevitable radiation\ndose. In the case of therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals, the radiation effect is the wanted\nproperty. Evaluation of the safety and efficacy of radiopharmaceuticals should include\nradiopharmaceutical and radiation hygiene aspects and radiation dosimetry in addition to\ngeneral parameters.\nRadiopharmaceuticals have changing composition with time, associated with the radioactive\ndecay. The physical half-life of the radionuclide is often so short that, in these cases, the\nfinal preparation has to be done immediately before administration to the patient; this leads\nto the use of semi-manufactured products such as radionuclide generators, precursors and\nkits. Evaluation of the safety and efficacy of radiopharmaceuticals is also concerned with\nthe specifications of generators, kits and other semi-manufactured products. Specifications\nmay also require special attention in cases where samples from the patient are labelled with\na radioactive substance before readministration (precursor radiopharmaceuticals). When\nradiopharmaceuticals go directly from the generator to the patient (e.g. ultra short-lived\nradioactive gases), the consistency of the production process has a particularly great\nimportance.\nThis note for guidance covers the following products:\n– ready-for-use radiopharmaceuticals;\n– non-radioactive components (kits) for combination with a radioactive component\n(usually the eluate from a radionuclide generator);\n– radionuclide generators;– precursors used for radiolabelling other substances prior to administration\n(e.g. samples from patients).']",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,1.0,1.0,1.0,7

In vial 1, the observedline deviated from the supposed ideal de-\ncay curve at approximately 8 min. This\nwas explained by leakage of air from the\nvial through the septum, causing the vial\nto contain more ﬂuid after a certain peri-\nod. In all other vials, the dilution process\nfollowed the exponential decay curve.\nThe median estimated decay constant was\n0.2477 (range, 0.1891 –0.3224). The medi-\nan time until 50% of the radioactivitywas infused was 3.5 min (range, 3 –4\nmin), for 75% 6.5 min (range, 5 –8 min), and for 95% 15 min (range,\n10–29 min).\nDISCUSSION\nIn the current study, we have shown that it is safe to administer\nPRRT in a time span of at least 5 min (this includes ﬂushing the\nadministration system twice, thus infusing the radiopharmaceutical\nin only 1.5 min). No additional toxicity was observed, and re-\nsponse rates according to68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT scans were\ngood. The added bene ﬁt of using the gravity method for adminis-\ntering PRRT is questionable, as the laboratory experiment showedthat with the gravity method 95% of the dose is administered in 15\nmin, and 50% in 3.5 min.\nThe current study shows that a total infusion time of 5 min (in-\ncluding thorough ﬂushing of the system) with a constant infusion\nrate is safe. In terms of clinical and biochemical toxicity, no addi-\ntional occurrence of adverse events was found. The toxicity pro-ﬁles in this study are similar to previous reported studies.\nBrabander et al. published a cohort of 582 patients, in which\ngrade 3 or 4 combined hematologic toxicity (thrombocytopenia,\nleukopenia, and anemia) was observed in 10% of patients ( 18). In\nthe NETTER-1 trial, grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia occurred in 2%of patients, grade 3/4 leukopenia occurred in 1% of patients, and\ngrade 3/4 anemia was not seen after PRRT. In the current study,\noverall hematologic toxicity was quite similar (3.2% of patients,\ndue to thrombocytopenia). There was no grade 3/4 anemia or leu-\nkopenia in the current study population. However, Brabanderet al. reported grade 3/4 lymphocytopenia after PRRT in 50% of\npatients, whereas the NETTER-1 trial reported the same in 9% of\npatients. In the current study, lymphocyte counts were not ana-lyzed, as it was not measured regularly in all patients. As ob-\nserved in both mentioned studies by Brabander et al. and the\nNETTER-1 investigators, renal toxicity after PRRT is rare, most\nimportantly due to the combined infusion of an amino-acid solu-\ntion during treatment. Grade 3/4 renal toxicity is generally re-ported in 1% of treated patients, but in our cohort, no patients\nhad grade 3 or 4 renal toxicity. Therefore, and considering the\nFIGURE 1.

The \nmolecular targeting mechanism and the type of ionizing \nradiation emission vary for different radiopharmaceuti-\ncals and may have important implications for the benefits \nand limitations of these agents.\nTheranostics is a concept related to radionuclide ther-\napy, but it specifically refers to the use of a pair of radio-\npharmaceuticals containing radionuclides for imaging (di-\nagnostics) and/or therapy (therapeutics) (1). Radionuclides \ncan be attached to a vector (eg, small molecule, peptide, \nantibody, particle) through a linker molecule, and the vec-\ntor, also referred to as a ligand, binds to a target (eg, cell \nsurface receptor). The radiopharmaceutical location can \nbe imaged using a SPECT or PET scanner, with the stan-\ndardized uptake value used as a measure of the amount \nof radiopharmaceutical in each location of the body. Ide-\nally, the radiopharmaceutical is mostly bound to the target \n(minimal off-target binding) or has exited the body, with \ntrace amounts circulating in the blood.

35E naive RAG,What is theranostics?,english,general,definition,command-r-plus naive RAG,"Theranostics is a concept in nuclear medicine that combines diagnostics and therapy, specifically by using a pair of radiopharmaceuticals containing radionuclides for imaging and therapy. It involves the coupling of diagnostic and therapeutic tools related to the same specific molecular targets, enabling more accurate patient selection, prediction of treatment response, and response evaluation, with the goal of improving patient outcomes.","['REVIEW\nBackground\nRadionuclide therapy refers to the application of an un-\nstable nuclide, coupled with a targeting vector, to selec-\ntively deliver therapeutic radiation to cancer cells. The \nmolecular targeting mechanism and the type of ionizing \nradiation emission vary for different radiopharmaceuti-\ncals and may have important implications for the benefits \nand limitations of these agents.\nTheranostics is a concept related to radionuclide ther-\napy, but it specifically refers to the use of a pair of radio-\npharmaceuticals containing radionuclides for imaging (di-\nagnostics) and/or therapy (therapeutics) (1). Radionuclides \ncan be attached to a vector (eg, small molecule, peptide, \nantibody, particle) through a linker molecule, and the vec-\ntor, also referred to as a ligand, binds to a target (eg, cell \nsurface receptor). The radiopharmaceutical location can \nbe imaged using a SPECT or PET scanner, with the stan-\ndardized uptake value used as a measure of the amount \nof radiopharmaceutical in each location of the body. Ide-\nally, the radiopharmaceutical is mostly bound to the target \n(minimal off-target binding) or has exited the body, with \ntrace amounts circulating in the blood. These images allow \nthe visualization of the target for diagnosis and staging, the \nselection of patients whose tumors express the target, con-\nfirmation of therapeutic delivery to all intended targets in \na patient, the calculation of effective radiation delivered to \nthe target (ie, dosimetry), and follow-up treatment moni-\ntoring (Fig 1) (2).
